No, you can't break. No, You can't break what is unshakable no. I was born with an honest soul As I grew old I learned to play the part of the fool who gained the world, lose it all and have to start all over again. Then in came Jesus show me how to be a better man. Found fatal rock bottom with my brothers I'm back on top again. Made a fire made of blood made of pain, made of love O oh, you can break. What is unshakable oh, you can break. World is unshakable oh, yeah.

Ladies and gentlemen, get ready. He doesn't just speak on a stage, he commands it. He doesn't just train. He empowers. From dozens of countries to thousands of entrepreneurial minds, meet Dr. Toby Potter. The speaker that brought my attention today was Toby Potter. He said something that was really amazing. Sometimes you go through things that will take us apart, but it's a process for us to grow. He's known around the world as the unshakable investor. A strategist, a player, a mentor who knows risk, reward and results. When he steps into this room, you will feel it. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[03:50]*: The energy changes, the expectation rises, the possibilities expand. When someone starts to get coached by Toby, the biggest thing to me that they're going to get out of it is he is someone who there's no problem that is too unachievable or too big to overcome. Working with Toby is inspiring. And it leads you to believe that you can complete things, you can get things done that you didn't always think you could. There's always a path, some way to get to an end goal. If you want to take the time to figure it out. He helps you unlock more. More vision, more legacy, more impact. Whether you are an investor, an entrepreneur, a leader, this is your moment. You will learn how to structure opportun. When others only see risk, you will leave with tools you can apply tomorrow. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[04:51]*: So raise your energy, open your mind, prepare your questions. And now, with no further delay, please put your hands together. Bring the volume up for the one, the only, Dr. Toby Potter. Hey, hey, everybody. How are we doing? Holy Cow. What an amazing night we are going to have tonight. First and foremost, though, I want to say kudos to every one of you because you showed up. Out of all the people that registered and all the people that always register that never show up, you guys and girls took the first step. The most important step is you showed up. So if I could give you a round of applause by everybody that's on here, I would. But give yourself a hand because that is so important, making that decision to take time out of your evening to show up tonight. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[05:58]*: But real quick, as you can see, we got a split screen here. I want to just do a little bit of housekeeping. If you're having trouble reading the screen or seeing it, you have the ability to grab the center where it's split and scoot that over left or right. That'll open up one side or the other, make it, expand it, or shrink it. So just for those who need to see it or want to peel out a slide and read it deeper, that's how you would do it. We're going to split screen this so that you can see the presentation, but also see me. Many years ago, I started a company. I thought I had the world by the tail. And because I didn't have structure, because I didn't have what I'm going to show each and every one of you tonight. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[06:53]*: It almost cost me everything. Not just the money, not time, but it cost me my identity, my confidence. It almost cost me my family. Many, many nights after that loss, I'd lay awake at three in the morning wondering, what do I do now? Where do I go from here? And I made a vow and I made a promise that when I rebuild, when I overcome this, I'm going to write it down. I'm going to build a program and build a system, and then I'm going to share it with the world. And as you saw, I'm now on stages on podcasts, teaching business owners just like you how I went from losing it all to rebuilding and growing. And I'm sharing it with you tonight. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[07:49]*: And it was through those midnight, two, three in the mornings, just laying there in the dark, crying out, where do I go? What do I do to this evolution take place? So sit tight tonight, because I'm going to share with you exactly what you're asking for, exactly what you're looking for and how you, too can have everything you've ever wanted in life. Here's my question to you. Before we get started, let me back this mess up. One, I want to know where everybody is coming from. Where are you at tonight? What city, town, state are you in? So put it in the chat right now, and let's get this thing fired up, because one of the things that I know that you've been taught, the more you put into something, the more you get out of it. So we're going to start right here. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[08:49]*: I want to know who my audience is. I want to know where you're coming from, where you're at, and if you got the seven and a half inches of ice we got here in Dallas, Texas, because it has been unbelievable. But the more you put in, the more energy you give me, the more I'm going to get back to you. And I promise you, because you showed up tonight, this is going to be an epic event. We're giving away prizes. We're giving away lots of stuff. And as you comment, as you engage, I got Randy in the back room watching, writing names down. And then we're going to spin the wheel here in a little bit and start giving away stuff. But I need you involved. You showed up to learn. You showed up to get educated. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[09:39]*: You showed up because you're inspired and you want more. So do me a favor. Do yourself a favor. Be engaged, be involved. Ask lots of questions throughout this whole thing. Ask questions. If I say something and it doesn't resonate with you, I got Nick right here on the computers. He'll see the question, and we will stop what we're doing right then and there it and answer it. And also, I'm gonna have Randy right now, throw into the chat if you see that this is what you're looking for and you want to go ahead and book a call throughout any part of this presentation, click that link, book the call. Doesn't cost you anything, but you're going to gain everything out of it. So just interact, chitchat, ask me questions. Tell me you love my hair. Tell me you love my beard. I don't care. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[10:30]*: Tell me you love our new shirts. Becoming unshakable. The team is wearing them because we want to resonate with all of you, help you become everything that you've ever desired. Because, see, I almost lost that beautiful family right there because I wasn't structured. My business wasn't structured. And when the storms of life came, I almost lost it all. So let's get started, because I know this is what you're looking for. Here's the number one question I'm going to ask you right here, right now. How long are you going to continue to let your Business, run your life. And the other thing I'm going to tell you, and this may. This may sting a little, but you need to hear it. Stop blaming things you can't control. Stop it. You can't control the economy. You can't control the tariffs, you can't control the interest rates. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[11:27]*: You can't control a lot of things that's going on in the world, so stop blaming it. The only thing you can control is you. And if your business isn't where it should be, it's because of you. And I don't mean that in a negative way, but I want you to hear me. Because by the end of this, you're going to feel me. You're going to fully understand how I have the right and the authority to point that finger at you. And I know there's three more point back at me, but I've been there and I did the same thing. I blamed everything. I blamed the financial crisis and I pouted around until I realized one thing. If it's going to be, it's up to me. And this is the only thing that you can control is you. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[12:16]*: How long are you going to let your business run your life? Why is your business stuck? We did a survey for everybody that was registering, and we asked you, out of the five things, what do you want to learn the most? Number one, three and five tied. Number one was getting clear on what's holding me back. Building a structure that doesn't rely on me and preparing for future capital. Why is your business stuck? You stick with me tonight and I'm going to show you exactly why your business suck. And I guarantee you it's not what you think. But it's the exact thing that I discovered and how I built the empire that I have today. With these pillars that I'm going to show you there's two realities, but only one choice you can make tonight. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[13:06]*: Where you are or where you want to be where you are. Business is flat. Business doesn't do anything without you. You're working over 60 hours a week, and you have no time for strategy or for family. And you're exhausted. Physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted. But you know you can't slow down because if you do, the business collapses. That's where most of you are. That's where I was. Where you want to be is owning and running. Predictable revenue that continues to grow quarter after quarter. A team that executes without you having to micromanage them. And you, the visionary, working on the business, not being trapped in it. You want clarity. That Drives profit. And you're building something that gives you options. Those options are either to sell or to scale. That's why we all started our own business. That's exactly why you became an entrepreneur. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[14:16]*: That's what you wanted. Freedom, financial freedom. Time, better opportunity for my family, better things for my family. And control. And you got none of that right now. You've got none of that. Let me paint a picture for you. And this is what I lived. I told the wife I'd be home around 7. I roll in around 9. Kids have already gone to bed. I've got a plate on the counter. The food is cold. And I've made this promise time after time. But I'm so busy in the business that I have no time for anything else. I come in, I pop the laptop. I got one more thing I gotta do. Sweetie. One more thing and I'm coming to bed. And two hours later, I finally close the laptop. And now it's midnight. She's fast asleep. And I'm laying there and my mind is racing. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[15:22]*: Your mind is racing. You're thinking about the customers that you got to deal with tomorrow. You're worried about. You're worrying about or thinking about the employees that you have to deal with tomorrow. You're looking at the inventory. All these things that's got to go on tomorrow is racing through your mind. If this is you, if any of this resonates with you in the chat right here, right now, put me. See, I know this resonates because you guys told me it resonates. But here's where there's. Honesty needs to come into play. This is where you have to be honest with yourself. Look at this. Just lighten it up. Exactly. And you're tired of it. You're fed up with it. You're exhausted, and you want more. I want clarity. I want more time. I want to scale and grow. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[16:21]*: Here's the thing that nobody shares with you. The invisible cost of staying where you're at. The real price of staying stuck. The deals that you're leaving on the table because you just can't scale. You can't take on anymore the team members who you hire trained and thought, you know what? This guy, this girl, she's going to be the rock star that I'm looking for. They leave because they don't see the growth and the opportunity that you promised them. And we as owners know, I know how expensive that is. To hire, train and lose. Hire, train and lose. Hire, training, lose. It is most irritating thing that every business owner goes through. You're missing opportunities because you're so buried in the day to day operations. And the business never becomes scalable or sellable. Staying stuck is not playing safe. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[17:17]*: Staying stuck is the most expensive decision you'll ever make. Here's who you become or who's who you desire to become. This is the industry, the business that you started. This is where you saw yourself when you planted that flag. You wanted to lead and should lead through systems, teams, data and architecture. This is what you want. Not lead through chaos, not through heroics. You're not to have a one man show where all decisions have to come through you and never have to. You never want to have to make decisions on gut feelings. I've talked to a business owner the other day and I said, how did you make that decision? Well, that's what my. I just went with my gut. I'm like, oh my gosh, that's the stupidest thing you could ever do. But it worked out for you. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[18:10]*: But it's not what you do. We make decisions based upon facts. That's how you scale and grow business and that's how you remove chaos. Because if that decision was wrong, now he had a multitude of fires that had to be put out. The gap between a $500,000 a year business and a $5 million year business, it's not more effort, it's infrastructure that we're going to show you tonight. I'm going to show you how to get rid of all the chaos, to build teams that lead, to free up time so that you can do more for yourself, for your family, for your business and be capital ready. The Unshakable Empire operating system is that bridge of where you're at right now and where you want to go. You know, when you started your business, you had a vision, you had a dream. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[19:10]*: Now you have a nightmare. If you're like me, it was the most chaotic thing I'd ever. Many, many times I wanted to walk away and close the doors and go work for somebody else because it was becoming a nightmare. But see, that's not who we are. We didn't start businesses to quit. But if I could find answer, if I could find a solution, I can scale this thing to multitudes. And that's what you're going to find tonight. Those are the things that we're going to show you that guarantees the results you're looking for. See, you've read, you bought the books, you've been to the conferences and you've hired coaches and consultants and you're still where you are today because nobody told you this. You don't have a knowledge problem. You have an execution problem. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[20:00]*: All those coaches, all those conferences, all those books gave you information, but it never helped you execute to the solution. Zig Ziglar told me and says it better than anybody. Motivation and information without education leads to frustration. Every one of you resonates with that. I've been to this, I've done that. But I've not gained, I've not grown. In fact, all it did was take away time and money. And you're tired of that. And I was, too. So you need a system that turns strategy into daily executions. And that's exactly what I'm going to show you tonight. So as I said, Randy's put book a call into the chat, the link to book a call. If at any time any of this starts resonating with you and you more. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[20:56]*: You want to hear more, learn more, do more, go ahead and book those calls anytime through this presentation, okay? Because what we're doing tonight is giving away free gifts for anybody who books a call tonight. And this is tonight only. And I'll share those with you. But just booking the call gives you about $5,000 worth of giveaways. Let me tell you a little bit about me real quick so that you can understand why I have the right to stand here and tell you how I can guarantee we will change the direction of your business. As I mentioned, My name is Dr. Toby Potter. I am called the Unshakable Investor. I invest in people and in businesses. I lost it all. I rebuilt it. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[21:44]*: I started with nothing, being almost homeless with that family that you saw after the 2008 crash and rebuilt on the same principle that I'm going to show you tonight. And I rebuilt it to the level that I was ranked the top 100 fastest growing company inc. 5000 in 2022 after Covid. I won private lender of the year in 2020. I have funded over $1.8 billion in transactions and have worked with over 7,000 individuals. I have the right to stand here today and tell you I know what's wrong with their business. And I have a system and a program that ensures growth and gives you everything you're looking for. I don't teach theory. I install the same operating system that I use to rebuild all those companies, including my own. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[22:40]*: After losing it all, I've had the privilege and the honor to hang out with Patrick Mahomes, Neil, Madonna, and if I don't know if you know who Neil Madonna, Yellowstone Justified the last ride. An amazing actor with amazing principles. Brad Lee on podcast Winning award after award. I did all this because I rebuilt on this platform and was able to have the success in the life that everybody is afforded and wants. I've written several books. But right here, right now, Randy, are you ready? We're going to give away a prize right here, buddy. So get ready because I want you in the chat right now to put in. What's the one thing that's the most important to you right now? Is it capital, personal growth, more staff, better staff. Owning, more real estate, investing in real estate, better automations, whatever it is. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[23:42]*: What's the number one thing right now so that we can give away some stuff that's the most important thing to you that you're looking for? Gabrielle Buchanan. Here we go. Gabriel Buchanan. Be ready. So let's see what all Gabrielle Buchanan is going to win. Here's our will. We've got some Starbucks, We've got coaching. We've got a free business assessment. 30 days of our AI that's customized for you. So here we go, Gabrielle, Free coaching call. Gabrielle. Randy, get with Gabrielle.

We're going to turn your life around and help you design the most amazing life you've ever wanted. Okay. All right. All right, Here we go. All right. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[24:48]*: Since I lost everything and since I rebuilt the one thing that I told you when I was laying there at 3 o' clock in the morning, I said, when I built this and I rebuilt it and I have success. My vision, my passion is now to be on stages and podcasts around the world teaching every person like you how I got there. These is proof what I've done. I've been in Africa, Pakistan, Dubai, all throughout the United States, working with individuals just like you to help them achieve the life they desire. I just flip the switch. I don't know nobody else is doing this. Body start to drop. Now they want to know me. Since I hit the top, Mindset's only thing I have, mindset fear. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[25:50]*: The reason why, from my experience, the reason why people don't do what they really want to do is fear exclusively. And Ziglar taught me a long time. I had the ability to work for Ziglar and with him and I was doing sales training for mortgage companies. And it gets so frustrating. We go in there and do an amazing Presentation, standing ovation, blah, blah. And it's okay. Now, are you going to buy this package? And you'd have little success. And I said, what are we doing wrong? He said, we're not. But you have to understand people will do exactly what they want to do. We got a question. So before we move on, Nick, my man says we got a question. What's the question, buddy? Now I gotta go back and find it. Now we gotta find it. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[26:35]*: Yeah, give us two seconds because I definitely want to answer the questions as we're going along because I want interaction from you. This is all about you. What you got there, Nick? So Mariah said, how do you allocate time and money to put structure in place when you're recovering from that lack of structure of the past, from time and money diverted to past errors? Yeah. So that's a great question, Mariah. And this is what we do with you now. I want to make sure that we're crystal clear. I will do nothing for you. I will do everything with you. But when we do that analysis, when we do that deep dive on your business, there's going to be things you're doing day in and day out that you think you have to be doing. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[27:20]*: There's small fires that we need to just forget about and be able to focus on the big forest. And when we do that, you'll start seeing in free of time. And I'm going to show you in some examples how we freed up other people's time, enabled them to scale immediately, get money because they're able to focus on better opportunities, better customer service. But it's all about looking at your time management and really dissected what is important, what isn't. And as a business owner now, I'm going to be the first to admit I am an alpha male. I'm a type a person. I'm everything that you want to call. I'm a control freak. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[27:59]*: And when I realized early in my rebuilding what was holding me back, it was just that I thought I had to make every decision, put out every fire, and I didn't entrust in my team. And the minute I did, it was tough, it was hard. But the minute I did, my business soared. Here I am meeting with Kevin Harrington. I don't know if you guys know who Kevin Harrington, but this is very important why I'm showing this to you. Through all my success and growth, I was able to meet co author book with Kevin Harrington, who was one of the original sharks on Shark Tank. He's also better known for as seen on TV. He was the guy that launched that in the 80s. Maybe some of you weren't around then, but this was Kevin Harrington. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[28:41]*: I show you this because of my profound relationship with him. And where this comes in here in a little bit you have this real estate coaching program that you now teach. You launch this and let's talk about that. There is so many people out there trying to get into real estate and investing that I want to share how were able to achieve that. Started in 94 as we all know, had the big crash in 2008. So we built an empire through that was doing real estate, had a ReMax franchise, had a title company, was doing fix and flips all that lost all that through the crash and then had to rebuild. Started Another company in 2015 was building it for exclusive hard money lending. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[29:22]*: Then we had Covid hit and another debacle who shut down that industry and then of course rebuilt immediately was named private lender of the year. Was Inc. Magazine top 100 fastest growing company in 2022. So from all those pitfalls and disruptions were able to rebound and build bigger. And so we created. So I've been there, done that and I just show that real quick to give you my resume that I'm not just here speaking of theory. I'm going to teach you, work with you through true life battle scar driven success. So this is not coaching. You can get coaching from people that are bigger than me. Tony Robbins, Maxwell, Stephen Covey. There's so many more people that are motivators, that are coaches. This is not that I will inspire you, that's for sure. Got a ton of energy. I will inspire you. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[30:19]*: But this is all about execution. You're done with coaching, you're done with motivation, you're done with being poured information. You're ready now to say how? How do I take this knowledge? How do I take all this and make it monetized? That's what we do is we help execute. We install the infrastructure in 90 days we're going to install these four pillars that I'm getting ready to share with you that will scale your business from chaos to a command center. And then from that we're going to offer you a fifth pillar which is the bonus. Five systems. 90 day install equals a permanent infrastructure that scales, grows and gives you everything you've ever desired. When we first talk with each business, the first thing we look at where are the profit links? 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[31:23]*: And these are the top three things that we discover with every business link. Number One, no CEO rhythm. The CEO all day long, every day is reactive. Putting out fires, not leading with growth. How many people does that resonate with? Number two, no scalable team. See you as a CEO just like me was the bottleneck. Every decision had to be made by you, everything had to be cleared by you. You were doing everything. And because of that, quality drops when you're not there. And you can't scale because the entire business depends upon you. That's link number two. Leak number three, no visibility. You do not know which activities drive the biggest profit. Marketing feels like you're gambling. You're throwing darks at a wall in the dark. And because of that, you cannot optimize what you can't measure. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[32:29]*: These are the three most common leaks in every business that we look at and deal with. And when we discover these, we start figuring out why and how to resolve, fix and grow. This is where the pillars come in. But before I get into the meat of why you're here tonight, the absolute how, I need you to take two seconds, I really need you to do a self diagnostics and we're going to give away another price right here. But I need you to think honestly within yourself. If any of this resonates with you, put a me in the chat. If you took 30 days off, would your business decline or collapse? Your team cannot close high ticket items without you assisting or in the room. You do not know each and every week exactly which activities creates the revenues. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[33:31]*: And most importantly, and here's where everybody on your better hit of me. If nothing changes in the next 24 months, where will your business be? And that's really just a deep thought internally. Are these things you've thought about, are these things that have crossed your mind? Is these things you're living each and every day? Randy, who do we have for winner number two? Who? Burn, Nuala, burn. Nuala, burn. Here we go, here we go. Nuala, if you're here, chat. What do you want to win on the wheel? You want a Starbucks? You want a 30 day with the AI program? Do you want free coaching? Tell me what you want. Nuala, real quick. She come up. No. Free coaching. Free coaching. Free coaching. All right. Free coach. You got her. Yeah. Boom. Free coaching it is. Holy cow. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[34:43]*: Nuala, you and I are going to Vegas. So Randy, get her information. This lady is lady luck. We're taking her to Vegas because we just land. And I promise you that was not rigged. But that's how good it is. Free coaching it is, girlfriend. All right. Here we go. Hope that was a lady. All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to get into this now and I want you to hear what I'm saying because you've already acknowledged everything that I've pointed out as the problem. I'm now going to give you the solutions that we work with you. And again, at any point in time this starts resonating with you, book a call, get on the calendar and let's diagnose your business. It's free. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[35:34]*: Let me assess it, let me tell you where I see the leaks are and how we install these four pillars that I'm ready to go over. Pillar number one is the very first thing that must be fixed. Command center, CEO, operating rhythm. What does that mean? We're going to install a weekly rhythm that transforms you from being a firefighter. As Miranda said, how do I find time? She's a firefighter. To a CEO. You'll know exactly what to focus on, what to delegate and what to ignore. See, most people think they have to address everything. It's the first thing we look at. Then we're going to map out the five core functions within your business. Sales operations, delivery, finance and leadership. These are the five core operations that we look deep into, map it out and put in metrics in place. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[36:36]*: This helps us identify time, money and quality from that. Build that weekly co cadence where you're having metrics and priorities, knowing exactly what needs to be dealt with and the time that needs to be dealt with. And then install the decision filters so that you as a CEO, these deals do not hit your desk. They do not hit your desk. And just think about it for a second. Look at a Michael Dell, look at a Jeff Bezos, look at Bill Gates. Those guys do not answer the questions you're dealing with. Why? They don't need to. They have people do that. They hired people and now they're multi billionaires. They weren't always, but this four pillar system that I show you tonight is exact ones they use also it's exact system. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[37:27]*: The result from us just correcting, fixing and installing pillar number one is your wheat becomes predictable and growth becomes intentional. We know exactly how you're going to grow and we hit that measurement, we hit that metrics and we continue to grow it. Pillar number two, team architecture. People who execute without you. This is the problem right now. This is the problem. I had my team would not make a decision. They have to have ownership. We're going to install role clarity, performance metrics and accountability systems that let Your team operate independently from you, but with the same morals and values that you instilled and created the business from. From that each team member has a understanding of the outcomes of their job, their role, their responsibilities. With authority, we measure performances. But here's the thing. Here's what really churns the company. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[38:37]*: Creating, installing, the unshakable culture. I want you to think about that. The unshakable culture that means no matter what, life will not break up the team. Letdowns, disappointments, lost accounts doesn't affect the team because the team is bought in. They have the burn the boats mentality. They not only drink the Kool Aid, but they make it. When you have an unshakable culture, everybody is the CEO. Everybody has ownership. Everybody wants success because they get rewarded along with you. Right now, your employees say, you know what? I work for them. And they're the ones making the money. They don't know the stress, they don't know the frustration. They don't know the hours. All they know is the company's making all this money, so they must be wealthy. The biggest myth, along with owning a business. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[39:41]*: But when they fully understand the vision, the passion, the legacy, and they get bought in, they rally no matter what. And when things go wrong, nobody blames everybody else. Everybody takes ownership. That is the unshakable culture that every business must have result from. Number two is your business runs whether you're there or not. Can you imagine that taking two, three weeks out? Remember the question, if you took 30 days off, what would your business do? Almost all of you said it'd be done. Can you imagine taking a week, two weeks, three weeks off, and the business runs as if you were still there? What a life. That's the vision you had when you started the business. That is the aspirations that you're shooting for. That is the goal you're looking for. That is what we do for you. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[40:37]*: Pillar number three, we got the CEO in line, got them out of the way. They're not the bottleneck anymore. We built a team that has accountability, has clarity, takes authority, takes ownership. Now pillar number three is ready to be installed. Revenue pipeline. Predictable scalable income. Install a system that identifies your most profitable clients, builds offer ladders, that captures full value and creates tracking that shows exactly what's working and what's not. See, we have to know your perfect client. You have to know your perfect client. I had a plumber the other day and I said, what is your perfect avatar? What is your perfect client? He goes, anybody's got plumbing Problems. I'm like, oh, you gotta be kidding me. I said a different word. He's like, what? I mean, I said, dude, we need to know exactly. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[41:29]*: You need to know exactly what your customer looks like. You gotta know. We're going to design that with you. Build an offer ladder so that they become a customer for life, continued revenue source. And then we're going to build a script for the sales process so they can discover that is the perfect avatar or not. How to diagnose their problems, solve their problems and close the deal. The other thing that we have to teach and I remove this word from my whole team. We don't sell anything. I removed the word sales. If I heard anybody say, oh, I'm here to sell this, they got in trouble. Sales is a bad word. We solve problems. We're customer service problem solving consultants. When you solve problems, everybody wants to work with you. Nobody wants to be sold. Okay? 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[42:34]*: We change that mindset, we change that dynamics and that's when you start creating that unshakable culture. Because now they feel like they're entitled. They have empowering authority to make decisions to solve problems. When we do this and create this script that says this is our perfect avatar, here's who you go after, here's how you work through that problem solving, diagnostics, you have great closures and great customer service result from number three. Pillar number three is revenue now becomes predictable. We now know what's working, what's not working, how we go get it, and what revenue that's going to generate for us and growth becomes systemic. That's just from pillar number three. The final pillar number four is conversion intelligence. Conversion intelligence. You'd be amazed at how many customers, how many clients I talked to and I said, tell me about your marketing. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[43:33]*: Oh, we, we spend a lot of money in SEO. We're top rate, top in Google searches. Are you kidding me? Google is dead. If you're spending time, money and energy on Google SEO, trust me, that is wasted money. Google is a resume. People go to Google to validate what you do and who you are. They don't go there to find you. Okay? And if they are, then that just means you got so many more customers you're missing. And we're going to help you discover how to triple your revenues. We install a tracking system for every stage of your buyer's journey. Identify the ones that drop off and build repeatable sequences that converts every lead to revenue without you having to worry about it. This is an automated system. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[44:27]*: You wake up in the morning, your calendar's full, you wake up in the morning, your team is out there closing deals. This is systems. You track every stage of the buyer's journey. You identify why a buyer dropped off at what stage. Was it the ad? Was it the landing page, was it the website? Was it booking the call? Was it before the you got a hold of them, where did they drop off and why? To help identify that perfect avatar, optimize measuring and positioning and then build repeatable closing sequences. Pillar number four results are stop guessing. So that every marketing dollar is accounted for means every dollar in. We know you're gonna get $35 back. Every time you spend a dollar on marketing, you get 35 back. When this system's in place, you're going to have a trackable roi. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[45:22]*: It ensures if I invest X amount of dollars, I'm going to get these clients, they're going to buy this product or service and I'm going to get this much money from them. That's what this does, that's conversion intelligence. And when you implemented those four, and they're working and you're running and gunning, we now make you eligible for pillar number five, which is where Kevin Harrington and the team came in. Pillar 5 is now your capital ready. Many of you, we had almost 42% of people said preparing for future capital. What are you looking for tonight? Preparing for future capital. This is what we do for you. This is the pillars that we build. These are the results we give you. And not only do we give you this, but more importantly, we give back your time, we give back your peace of mind. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[46:24]*: Because now you're loving everything you're doing, you're excelling in everything. And everybody around you is excited, is happy and loving. You know what that feels like? Probably not. That's where you want to be on pillar five. We will at that moment in time install a financial infrastructure, forecasting, reporting, pitch ready documents that makes your business attractive to investors, lenders or buyers. Remember, do I scale or do I sell? But now the choice is yours. Right now you don't have a choice right now. You know, you have to get up every day and go do the grind. Once this is in place, once this is running, you now have options. Do I scale it, do I sell it, Do I take a vacation? Do I go to work? Everything that you've dreamt about now becomes reality. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[47:23]*: The results is you're ready for the next level, whatever that looks like for you. But you have to understand this. So many of you are saying, oh, well, my marketing is great, my team is amazing. We know our client base. You may, and I'm going to show some stories with you here in a little bit. But here's where I messed up. Here's where you're messing up. It takes all four pillars to work in unison, lock in together because if one is off, they're all off. Most owners don't understand what's missing. And by giving you all five, you now have choices. We install the four to get your company capital ready. We now introduce you to Kevin Harrington. Any of the sharks that we need to high net worth investors, family offices, banks, it doesn't matter. We now know that you're capital ready. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[48:33]*: And those people that we work with know that you've gone through our program, know that what we're providing to them is legit. I don't know if you guys know the statistics on Shark Tank. I'm going to share it with you real quick so that you understand how important this is. And speaking with Damon John off of Shark Tank, he said that 72% of the deals that they agree to on Shark Tank that you see that the sharks say I'm in and a deal is made, 72% of those fall out, 72% fall out after they've already said I'll do it. Because once they get the financials, once they get the true understanding of the operations, they don't have four pillars running together. They may have a great product, they may even have great sales, but it's a one man show. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[49:27]*: And if something happens to that inventor or that CEO, then the whole business falls apart. You can't invest in that. Nobody's going to invest that. You have to invest in the system of the business to ensure that no matter what, it continues to run. If anybody leaves, especially the founder, they all have to work together. This is what we will discover on that call with you book your call, we'll go through it. It's a 30 minute call. We'll assess what's working, what's not and put a plan in place for you all free of charge. You're at a crossroads right now and is there any questions? Nick, before we go into the deeper dive. Yeah. What you got? Got one that asks what usually changes in the first month or two once someone starts working with you on a program. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[50:23]*: So the very first 30 days we're doing a deep dive and we're discovering how deep of a bottleneck you as a CEO are creating. How many things do you have your hands in that don't need to be there. The first 30 days is assessing your day to day action, the team's day to day action, and each person's role and responsibility. So the first 30 days is after we give you the roadmap, after we give you the plan, we start looking and dissecting and moving people into the right spot. The first 30 days is a little bit chaotic because it's disruptive. And then things start smoothing out. Okay, foreign for a hard decision right here, right now, there's two paths to moving forward. Two choices to look at. Two options. One choice. Keep doing what you're doing. Keep blaming the economy, keep blaming the employees. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[51:26]*: Keep blaming whatever you've been blaming. Stay the bottleneck, hope that next year is different. And then watch a competitor scale and grow and exit without you. Or book the call, Figure out what's wrong. Install the infrastructure that changes everything. See the one path you're comfortable with because you know what to expect. The other one is transformational. Here's the one thing I will tell you the reason why people don't make changes. It's one word. Can anybody guess? We're gonna give away another prize. Randy. Can anybody guess what the one word is? And when you see it, Randy, come scream and let me know. It's a four letter word. What's the one reason why people do not make change? That's right, Deborah. Dee Dee. Yeah, Dee. Need the gossips. I saw it before you did, Randy. Sorry. You're too slow, bro. Dee Dee, Here we go. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[52:30]*: Fear is right. People do not make change because they're afraid. They're afraid. What if it doesn't work? What if I fail? What if? What if? What if? Stop saying what if Negative. Say what if it works. What if this is exactly what I've been looking for. What if I now get everything I've ever wanted in life? Think that way, because that's what you will achieve. Whatever the mind can conceive, the body will achieve. All right, Deborah, we go. What do you want, Deborah? See. See if we can continue. If we can go two for two. What do you want off the wheel, Deborah? Book a call. Book a call. Here we go. We'll book a call. That's free. Starbucks it is. Deborah, I hope you're a coffee drinker if you not give it to a cooworker. 20 employees, huh? It's dd I'm sorry. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[53:21]*: Didi, didi. $50 Starbucks. All right, here we go. Yep. I was hoping this was the next slide. Here's what I hear every time. And. And And Miranda said it, what if we don't have time? What if I don't have time? What if I don't have money? What if I don't have resources? What if, what if? What if? And we're so busy trying to find out how it won't work. Work. We don't spend the same time and energy figuring out how it will. But here's what I can promise you this. And I'm going to show you some examples. Systems create time. I'm going to show you this, I think, in the next slide. True stories. I've tried coaching before. I know. So did I. I bought every book out there. I've been to every conference out there. When I lost it all, I needed help. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[54:16]*: I would set up at night, surfing the Internet, looking for answers. There's got to be somebody out there. Tony Robbins, Ziglar, Les Brown. Somebody's got to have the answers for me. John Maxwell, Stephen Covey, Simon Sinek. There's somebody. All these guys are amazing. Surely they got answer. And all they did was continue to motivate me that, yes, there's hope. Coaching doesn't work. Systems that we build work with you to execute. See, it takes action to get results. And if you don't know what action to take, that doesn't matter how much information you have. We give you the right, executable actions to get the results. We don't coach. We partner with you. You. My business is unique. It's not seen at all. You just don't see the pattern. You don't know the four pillars that we just went through. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[55:17]*: You don't see that this is part of your business is one or two or three of those pillars are broke. I can't afford this. This is the one that I'm going to take a quick. Just pause on. I can't afford this. I can't afford it. I don't have extra money. I don't have. I don't have again. Do you realize that a heroin addict finds a way every time to get heroin? An alcoholic, a bum finds ways to get their fixes. See, Ziglar taught me this. In the mid-90s, people will do exactly what they want to do. If you want everything that we talked about, you will find a way. You can't afford not to do this because what you've been doing hasn't worked. It hasn't worked. So stop telling yourself, I can't, I can't. And start telling yourself, I will. And I am. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[56:23]*: See, what you believe you will achieve, what you think of every day, all day long will manifest into those results. Let me tell you, for somebody who had it well and lost it all, was homeless, scared mad, blaming the financial crisis, turned it around simply because I believed. And I said to myself every day, if it's going to be, it's up to me. And nowhere did I have any money, but I knew that I could rebuild. You can too. You have the opportunity, you have the ability, and you can't afford not to make a change. Here is a real case study. This gentleman had his business for a little over two years, was cranking out $800,000 a year, putting in 65 hours a week, had three employees, two of them are part time. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[57:27]*: He was doing 85% of the business and he told me, toby, I don't have time, but this is killing me. My wife doesn't like me anymore, I'm never home and when I am, I'm grumpy. I don't know how we're going to do this. I said, Give me 90 days. In 90 days of implementing this program, his revenues doubled. His hours per work. Miranda, his hours per week cut in half. We were able to hire and train six full time employees and they were handling 40% of the deals in 90 days. That's how you find the money and the revenues by implementing the program. It creates time, it creates revenue. And this, the revenues, the profit from this double revenues paid for the progress. Sarah, wedding photographer working 70 hours a week, making $180,000 a year. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[58:30]*: That's $49 an hour she was making as a business owner. I promise you this, Sarah did not say, I want to become a wedding photographer and I want to crank out 50 bucks an hour and I'm going to live life high on the hobby because $200,000 a year gross revenues didn't pay for the cameras, the travel, the hotel and all the expenses and headaches she had to go through. I promise you this, after 90 days, we doubled her income. We cut her hours to 35, cut it in half, and she was able to hire and train a project manager to take on the fires that she didn't need to deal with. Mike H. Vac Co. Drowning in his business, had not gone on vacation over three years. About to lose his wife, she said, I'm done. We are not making any money. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[59:20]*: I don't ever see you. Why are we doing this? After six months of implementing the Unshakable Empire operating system, his business started running by itself. He took two weeks and took her to Italy and his revenues grew 40%. Jennifer Consulting Firm. $250,000 a year as a sole entrepreneur, burning a candle at both ends. And after one year, we almost quadrupled her income. She built a team of four and is now selling that company for over seven figures. See, she now has the freedom to choose. Do I scale or do I sell? But she had built up such a huge client base that selling gave her what she always wanted. Where do you stand in this? What do you want? I'm going to give you some testimonies because just so you know, it's real. Toby's a spitfire. Toby is a ball of energy. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:00:22]*: He is, he moves with purpose. He, he always has something to share with you. He always has a story to tell. He always has a way to encourage you. Fireball. I've never known anybody to have as much energy and as much zest for life and for building the kingdom as I have for him. If you really want to create change, if you really want to make an investment in yourself. I believe in what he's created. I've watched him do it and he's done it with a hundred percent. I've been working with these guys for a few months now. It's been great. He actually encouraged, encourages us a lot to go find the deals and keep pushing, pushing. So that's one aspect of it. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:01:13]*: The other aspect of it is to basically not even talk about real estate, but grow us professionally when it comes to like personal development spiritually. Toby Potter is an amazing person and his real estate and unshakable self. He's changed my life and if you give him the opportunity, he can change yours too. Just listen. Any questions before we jump into the program process? I know, hey, what's this program? What's the pricing? It's coming up, but you have any questions if we dump into this? Because now we're going to jump through really quick and get this thing rolling. Any question real quick? We good, Nick? Yeah, we're good. All right, here we go. Here's the program. This program is just what I explained to you and I'm going to go into it in great detail. But you have three options. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:02:11]*: A 30 day do it yourself, a 90 day done with you, or a 12 month done for you. What does that mean? What does that look like? So the 30 day is the empire operating system in that we're going to do a diagnostics, fully analyze your company, look at all four pillars, see where the leak Is and build a map to infrastructure that fixes that and scales in that 30 day. This is for people who are only missing one or two pillars and it's a quick fix to scale and grow. But what you get is all seven core systems templates, SOPS frameworks, complete video training library, over 40 hours implementation checklists and guides so that you know exactly what to do. Remember, execution creates results, action creates results. 30 day access to our member portal so that we have complete communications guided and direction. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:03:18]*: But mainly this is for that small company that says I just need to fix one or two things and then I can go. It's 49.95 one time but we're with you for 30 days and you have ongoing AI tool support and customer service support. The 90 Day Empire. This is the most sought after program. It's everything we just talked about. A full diagnostics, a full roadmap, a full assessment. And how do I get to where I need to get to in the next 12 months? This is done with you. So for 90 days you're getting one one coaching calls with me, not my team with me. We review your work, adjust the strategies, troubleshoot the problems. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:04:10]*: We make sure that we have a fully operational portal for communications, worksheets, workbooks, KPIs metrics, measures, all that, making sure the marketplace, everything that we talked about comes within this program. Then we have a monthly group session so that everybody, all the masterminds have input so you can hear from others how they're working through troubles. Whether it be employees, the marketing, be trends, whether it be tariffs, doesn't matter. Every mastermind, business owner is here to help you guide and direct for success and then customize systems. Remember, what we will not do is give you a one size system fits all program. I need you to hear me on this. If you go to Alex Hermosa, you go to Andy Elliott, you go tony Robbins, you go to any of those people and you buy a program that is the same exact program. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:05:11]*: I can buy that Nick can buy that, Randy can buy that your sister can buy. And how can that system help your business when it's not customized for your business? Our execution platform is customized specifically for you and your business. We do not release one size fits all programs. Okay? That's why it's so important we do the deep dive. This program right here for 90 days is 12,500 and we have payment options available for you. Let me put this into perspective. This helps you understand by doing this and saving just 15 hours a week and your billing is 150 to $200 per hour. That's $3,000 a week we're putting back in your business for you to strategize. Take advantage of opportunities to work hand in hand with your team to really give white glove customer service, which is how we scale the businesses. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:06:15]*: Option number 312 month. This is for that business that's really broke. The guy, the gal, the husband and wife that's just burning the candle at both ends and their marketing isn't working. They're out there trying to scoop up every client out there, but don't have a, a laser focus on what that avatar looks like. Their team is a revolving door and they really need to peel it back and scale it up. This is where 99% of our customers have the most success because it ensures and it guarantees that we put them on the right map and we hold their hand all the way through week after week. What do you get with this? Everything that we already talked about. But you get one one calls with me weekly for the next 52 weeks. You're in 12 months of the mastermind call. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:07:09]*: You get our AI systems and as we evolve, if you're not using AI and don't tell me you're using chat and you're using Claude and you're using Gemini and all that, those are not AI that I'm talking about. I'm talking about true customized AI for your industry. We build these, strategize, we structure, we dump all the information, and as it evolves, we update and implement for you. As you already know, AI is moving faster than light. And do you have time? If you're trying to get educated on AI, there's part of the bottleneck. It's not what you started your business for, it's not what you're an expert at. And we know you're damn good at what you do. I know this or you wouldn't be here tonight. And I know that you care about your program, about your company. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:08:05]*: It's what I always called my baby. And I would do anything for it to succeed. I know you would too. But you do not need to be spending time learning programs and systems. Let the experts educate, teach, and walk you through it so that you can implement, execute, and go on to the things that you do best. We train your team, we make sure that we have the right butts in the right seats, that they have ownership in their title, they have ownership in the responsibility, and they take full responsibility of their daily actions. Remember the Unshakable culture. This is what we establish, this is what we install and this is what we insure with you. It's 25,000. We do offer payment plans on that. Here's the thing that I want you to understand. I'm not here to upsell you. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:08:57]*: I will not upsell you. In fact, I'm going to tell you a quick story. We had a gentleman who came in and said, Toby, my business is just in the dump. I need the done for me. I need that $25,000 deal. I need you to break me down and build me back up. And went through it and I gave him an hour and a half of the diagnostics. I really wanted to see where the bottleneck was, where the problems were. When it was all said and done, there was two little pillars that weren't broken, they just needed tweaking. And we put together this master plan and I said, John, here's all you need to do. And if you'll do this for the next 30 days, I promise you can do this and you do not need me. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:09:39]*: So let's go with the do it yourself. And after 30 days you don't think you can handle it? We can then look at it. But I'm going to just only put you in the do it yourself program. And in 30 days, he sold. He said, man, you saved me $20,000 in cost, but you tripled my business and improved my life. I've had the same exact opposite story where an individual who's growing a really good business thought he only needed to do it yourself. He had three of the four pillars broken and he did not know how to get out of his own way. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:10:15]*: And I told him the only way we would work with you is allow us to do it for you because you've annihilated your team, you've annihilated your customers, and until we get you out of the way, this business will never scale and grow. And it took him a while. His ego was in the way. But the minute he released and said, okay, I've tried you, I've tried my way and it's just not working. Show me what you can do. And I said, here's the other one. I'm getting ready for you guys. I put a guarantee on all my stuff. If I don't show you results, we're going to make sure that you have results. He said, all right, do it. And we transformed his business and we turned it around and he's kissing her butts today. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:11:02]*: I need you to understand who this program is for if you're a startup with no revenues but you have a company and you just can't get it launched, these are not for you. We have another program. You can book a call and what we'll do is we'll look at what you're doing and I'll put together how that business would work, how you would operate it and how you would scale it. Because until you have revenues, these programs will not work. But we can get you started, we can build a footprint, we can build that foundation for you. It's a different deal. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:11:32]*: So book a call if you're in pre revenue, but if you are in revenue business and you're knee deep in chaos, you're working 60, 70 hours a week and everything depends upon you and profitability and growth is stuck, this is for you. And if you keep waiting, you have wasted time, lost revenues, team turnover, missed opportunities, those things themselves will cost you a hundred thousand dollars or more a year. And what I need you to understand what like I said in the beginning, it's not the cost that you look at, it's the investment and the reward that was big. My biggest deal, why would I want to pay for this? How can I insure this? How can I guarantee it? And then I stopped and said, you know what? 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:12:22]*: If you build it and you do it, then it's not a cost, it's an investment. And how many of us love a sure deal? A buddy calls and says, hey man, if you invest in, in Dell computers and it's going to go up 30%, I guarantee it. You're not, you're doing it. We all know about investments. And have you invested in you? Have you invested in your baby? Or are you too worried about the cost? This is the thing. It's a mindset. It's the first thing we work with, is having you fully understand the true potential of your investment. Now, as I mentioned earlier, because you stayed, because you're still here, because you're showed up, have interacted, engaged, we're going to give you some special gifts tonight. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:13:25]*: We're adding something special now for those people who have already booked a call and continue to book a call tonight and tonight only, we're going to give you these things I'm getting ready to announce. So Randy, make sure you've got that link up there. It doesn't get buried in the comments. Make sure you continue to throw that link in there. Because I want everybody to book a call and I don't want anybody say, well, I didn't Find the link. Randy's going to be in trouble if I hear somebody say that. Okay, but what we're getting ready to give you tonight only, when you book a call are these four things. I'm going to give you my AI. Customized AI. It's not chat, it's not Gemini. I can promise you this is a customized AI.

And quit blaming everything else. Quit saying, I can't start saying I am, I will, I want and I'm going to achieve. Whatever the mind can conceive, the body will achieve. See, I mentioned there's a bonus. Pillar number five. Pillar number five. Many, many of you said I need to get capital ready. And we're going to get you there. But here's the bonus to it all. We help you get the capital. Hi, I'm Kevin Harrington. I'm an original shark from the hit TV show Shark Tank. And I've helped launch over 500 products generating over $6 billion in global sales around the world. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:17:53]*: And I know what it takes to win over investors because of my relationship with Kevin Harrington, co authoring that book and doing many deals. We know what he looks for, what his partners look for. And when you implement the four pillars and we get you scalable, we present you in front of them, we allow you to get in front of them to raise capital or to have them buy your company, whatever choice you want. But through this program, and as I mentioned, people at shark tank, 72% fall out because they're not ready. We ensure my deal with Kevin and his team is that when they go through our program, the Unshakable Empire operating system, and we present their business, your business, to them, you're ready. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:18:45]*: They're not going to have to worry about any hidden, unforeseen, the books are right, the predictability is right, the scalability is there and you're ready. This is what we bring to the table. But let's recap real quick as we're wrapping this up. I know we've been on this for an hour and 15 minutes and I thank you so much. But see, you are investing right now in your business. So I'm going to wrap this up real quick, book a call tonight. What you get is a 30 minute diagnostic call. We go through it, then I build a customized business assessment report, send that to you get the VIP front row ticket and you get the 30 day trial to our AI to ask any question and have it answered so that you can. I can show you or the real deal. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:19:33]*: This is what you get when you book a call tonight and tonight only. The path to 1 million in 12 months, that's what I'm giving you is a path to scale and grow. And maybe it's your first million, maybe it's not. I can put your path to 10 million on it doesn't matter because once you earn your first million, the rest disease, see question is where are you going to be one year from now? Ask yourself this final question and we're going to do one more last drawing. But one year from now, where are you going to be? Still stuck, still the bottleneck. Still wondering why you can't break through, why you can't scale. Wondering we're still working in the business, not on it and still having the same chaos flat revenues year after year. Or where are you going to be? 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:20:31]*: Wouldn't you rather be running a scaled business with systems that execute a team that delivers with or without you? A company running and owning a company that's worth multiples and the freedom to lead, the freedom to grow, the freedom to live. When's the last time you've lived? This is what we're giving to you tonight. A life that you've always dreamt of. For your family, for yourself, for your health. The Empire operating system is that infrastructure to help you grow and scale your business and remove all the pressures, all the chaos and the bottlenecks that's held you back. Any questions? I only went 20 minutes over Nick. We're pretty good tonight. All right, Randy, let's do one more drawing. The first person to ask a question gets on the wheel. First one who's got a question, Huh? Yeah, yeah. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:21:41]*: So somebody asked, is this similar to Grant Cardone? No, absolutely not. Who? Carl Morgan Borden. Like the Milk Borgin. I can't hear you. You got like you got gum in your mouth or something. You're like you're chewing on something. Carl. Sorry for breaking. So to answer the question about no just because. And I'm better looking than the Grant Cardinal. Everybody on here say yes I am. Right now. Say yes I am. I'm better looking than Grant Cardo. I better see it come up or we'll just. All right, thank you. All right. No, this is not similar to Grant Cardone. Grant Cardone. Thank you. There we go. There we go. Now you guys see you guys still love me. Appreciate it. Been on for an hour and 20 minutes. I still love you. Grant Cardone sells courses and here's the deal. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:22:33]*: If you ever bought a Grant Cardone course, did you ever speak to Grant Cardone? No. You ever bought a Tony Robbins course? Did you speak tony Robbins? No. In fact, for all of you who have bought a course, how many of you spoke to the founder that created and built that course? The difference, twofold. One is Grant Cardone. All they do is upsell you upsell. They do not teach you anything. They do not help you execute. They do not implement. They'll give you a road map and then they'll try to upsell you if you say, hey, I need help how to implement this. Oh, yeah, that's this program. So if you buy this program, we'll help you implement that. It's not Grant Cardone, and I'm not Grant. We work with you. I work with you. You. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:23:29]*: And we execute and implement pillars, not courses, not motivation. I hope that answered your question. They are sales machines, period. You're right. That's all they're doing is they are upselling up selling. I told you, I do not want to upsell you. I will give you the program that you're qualified for. I will not sell you a do for you if you don't qualify for it. And I definitely won't put you on a do it yourself to have you fail. Yes, ma'. Am. When we implement the four pillars, they must not have been paying attention. Pay attention. Once the four pillars are implemented and your business is now scalable, we're going to. We have. The Wolf Den is a program that I run, and we have right now four of those Wolf Dens scheduled. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:24:28]*: It's just like Shark Tank where we're going to be in a city. You'll be invited to come there and pitch your program, and you'll be recognized as a graduate from the Unshakable Empire operating system. Therefore, they'll know you have gone through this and the numbers that you present to them are valid. The books that we present, the pitch that we help design for you is valid. And they know that it's legit and they don't have to worry about. Well, yes, I want to buy that company. I want to invest that company. That they have to worry about the due diligence causing it to fall out. That's how we raise capital for you and get you in front of it. So, Randy, I forgot the guy's name. Do you remember Nick? Carl. Carl. Carl. Here we go, Carl. Boom. Another Starbucks. Here we go, Carl. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:25:21]*: I hope you love coffee, buddy. Carl, get with Randy so that he can get your information. We can get this mailed out to you. But more important, Carl, you better book a call, buddy. You better book a call. He did. He did. Perfect. All right. All right. Any more questions, real quick. Last one I saw. Somebody asked about how or what do you usually see people try first when they feel burned out. That ends up not helping. Motivational tapes and books and seminars. The first thing that I see when I talk to somebody who's just burned out, they're just. They've been burning at both ends. I'm gonna sit down, Nick, and hope it doesn't cut me off. I don't think it will. I'm pretty good. The first thing we see. Who was at that. So I can talk to them directly. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:26:06]*: You have that name? No. Okay. They try to get more motivation. They try to get self help. They're burned out. They need a jolt. They need an energy. They need a monster drink emotionally. And so they go and they. They enroll into courses. And that's what they are. Those courses are specifically designed. And trust me, I launched my first business solely based on my relationship with Ziglar. It was all about the motivation, the inspiration, and the self belief that I could achieve anything I wanted is how I launched my first company before the crash of 2008. And so when people are burned out and they're struggling, they're emotionally drained, they're physically drained because now they're kind of depressed, they go and try to recharge that. And that's the first thing that we tell them. Stop. Motivation and information without education becomes frustration. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:27:07]*: So all you're doing is adding chaos to chaos. What'd they just say right there? All kinds of questions coming up. Ready put in the live event. What was the one before that in pink? I want action, not a course. Absolutely. I don't. And I won't give you a course. I can promise you. We started this out with. I am not here to motivate you. I will inspire you. I will help you firmly believe that you are the best at what you do. But you have to get out of your own way. So many times. Holy cow. So many times. I just. That was the first hurdle that we needed to overcome with our clients is show them. Just step back and enjoy your baby. Enjoy your vision, Enjoy your dream. And let me show you how your team will build this for you. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:28:10]*: You people. People go to work for owners. Two reasons. One, money. But everybody stays because they believe in the vision. Now, if you're having a revolving door, it's because they've lost the passion of the vision and they lose hope. But when you are a true visionary, when you're a true entrepreneur and you have a calling, people will go and walk through fire with you when they firmly believe you will support them and carry them through and reward them at the end. And that's what the unshakable culture is all about. And when you create that, it removes that stress, it removes all that pressure. And you sit back and you start taking deep breaths and you start getting excited and your family gets excited. They see the new you, they see that old you that started this when you started your business. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:29:14]*: I promise you, I can absolute promise you told the whole world, you told every neighbor, every family member, here's what I'm getting ready to do. And you were pumped and excited. And then it slowly died. Because now it became a job, became a ball and chain, it became a burden. Let's get back to that fire. Let's get back to that reason why you did it, the true reason, the true understanding, the true passion that you wanted that to become and the true fulfillment. That's where we're at. Book your call because it doesn't cost you a dime. We'll give you an assessment, you get it, and then you decide what you want to do with it. And what's funny is when we do the assessment and I get somebody like me, it's a little stubborn, a little thick headed. So I can do this. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:30:14]*: It usually about two weeks later, they call back, said, man, I don't have a clue what I'm doing. Let's just, let's just make this happen. And then we take off and we run side by side and we grow, we implement, we execute, and we all enjoy and celebrate. Do you want to be a part of that? Because as we're traveling this tour that's coming up, if you are privileged enough to book a call and get that ticket and you come to this live event, we're gonna share with everybody your commitment to your business. You're gonna be in a room full of entrepreneurs, but you're going to be the vip and Kevin and the team is all going to be there and they're going to already be putting eyes on you. They're already going to be seeing, hey, I like this person. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:31:04]*: I like what they're doing. Once Toby gives us the green light, let's look at him again. So book that call. Make the decision tonight. Quit making excuses, quit blaming everything else because you can't control it. If you can't control it cannot affect you unless you allow it. Take advantage of what we're doing. Take advantage of your opportunity, because I know you're amazing. I know you're the absolute best at what you do, or you wouldn't be doing it. Let's make it happen. We got one minute, and then I got to shut this down. Any more questions? Nick, by going too fast, I see lots of chat. No, that's it. That's it. All right. Ladies and gentlemen, I am so proud, so honored that each and every one of you not only showed up, but you stayed. 
**Dr Toby Potter  International Speaker** *[01:31:58]*: You made a commitment, you learned, you got educated, you got some inspiration, and many, many of it looks like many of you made the decision to book the call, and that is phenomenal, because you're the ones that's going to be telling your story and showing the transformation, and your family is going to thank you for that. You guys have an amazing night. Stay safe. If you got icy roads like we do, I think it's nationwide. Stay safe. Hopefully you guys are already home. We're getting ready to pack up, head out of here, but I will talk to you soon. God loves you. I love you. Be good.
