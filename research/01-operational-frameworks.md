## 1.1 LEVEL 10 MEETING AGENDA (Full 90-Minute Breakdown)

**Total Duration:** 90 minutes, no exceptions
**Frequency:** Weekly, same day, same time, every week
**Participants:** Leadership team (typically 3-8 people)
**Rules:** Starts on time. Ends on time. Same agenda every week. No devices unless referencing data.

### Exact Agenda Breakdown:

| # | Section | Time | Running Total |
|---|---------|------|---------------|
| 1 | Segue (Good News) | 5 minutes | 0:05 |
| 2 | Scorecard Review | 5 minutes | 0:10 |
| 3 | Rock Review | 5 minutes | 0:15 |
| 4 | Customer/Employee Headlines | 5 minutes | 0:20 |
| 5 | To-Do List Review | 5 minutes | 0:25 |
| 6 | IDS (Identify, Discuss, Solve) | 60 minutes | 1:25 |
| 7 | Conclude | 5 minutes | 1:30 |

### Section-by-Section Detail:

**SECTION 1 -- SEGUE (5 minutes)**
- Each person shares one personal best and one professional best from the past week
- Purpose: Human connection, positive energy, vulnerability
- NOT a status update -- this is personal
- Goes around the table, each person gets ~30-45 seconds

**SECTION 2 -- SCORECARD REVIEW (5 minutes)**
- Review the 5-15 numbers on the company Scorecard
- Each number owner reports whether their metric is on track or off track
- Off-track numbers get moved to the Issues List -- NOT discussed here
- Report ONLY: "hit" or "missed" -- no explanations, no excuses
- The discipline is speed: a quick pulse check, not a deep dive

**SECTION 3 -- ROCK REVIEW (5 minutes)**
- Each person reports each of their Rocks as "On Track" or "Off Track"
- No lengthy explanations
- Off-track Rocks move to the Issues List
- Simple binary status: thumbs up or thumbs down
- Goal: 80%+ of Rocks should be on track at any given time

**SECTION 4 -- CUSTOMER/EMPLOYEE HEADLINES (5 minutes)**
- Brief updates on notable customer or employee news
- Good news or bad news -- both reported
- Any item needing discussion goes to the Issues List
- Format: one sentence per headline, no debate
- Examples: "Lost Client X" or "Hired new ops manager" or "Client Y renewed for 3 years"

**SECTION 5 -- TO-DO LIST REVIEW (5 minutes)**
- Review all 7-day action items from the previous week
- Each person reports each to-do as "Done" or "Not Done"
- Target: 90% completion rate every single week
- Not-done items either drop off (no longer relevant) or carry forward
- If consistently below 90%, that itself becomes an Issue

**SECTION 6 -- IDS: IDENTIFY, DISCUSS, SOLVE (60 minutes)**
- This is the heart of the meeting -- 2/3 of total meeting time
- Team identifies the top 3 most important issues from the Issues List
- Issues are attacked one at a time using the IDS process
- Solved issues produce To-Dos with owners and 7-day deadlines
- Unsolved issues stay on the list for next week
- Average team solves 3-7 issues per meeting

**SECTION 7 -- CONCLUDE (5 minutes)**
- Recap all new To-Dos created during IDS
- Confirm who owns each To-Do
- Identify any cascading messages (what needs to be communicated to teams)
- Rate the meeting 1-10 (target: consistent 8+ ratings)
- Each person states their rating out loud

### L10 Meeting Rules:
1. Same Day, Same Time -- never moves
2. Same Agenda -- never changes
3. Starts on time -- even if people are missing
4. Ends on time -- no exceptions
5. No devices unless referencing meeting data
6. No tangents -- tangents go to the Issues List

## 1.2 THE SCORECARD STRUCTURE

### Definition
A weekly reporting tool containing 5-15 key measurable numbers that give you the "pulse" of your business at a glance.

### Column Structure (Left to Right):

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Who** | Single accountable owner (one person per number) |
| **Measurable** | The specific metric being tracked |
| **Goal** | The weekly target/threshold for that metric |
| **Week 1** | Actual number for Week 1 of the quarter |
| **Week 2** | Actual number for Week 2 |
| **...** | Continues across... |
| **Week 13** | Actual number for Week 13 (final week of quarter) |

### Key Structural Rules:

- **5-15 numbers total** -- enough to cover essentials, small enough to review in 5 minutes
- **13 trailing weeks displayed** -- one column per week, covering the full quarter
- **One owner per number** -- if two people own something, nobody owns it
- **Weekly targets, not monthly** -- every number has a weekly goal
- **Activity-based (leading) indicators preferred** over lagging indicators
- **Green/Red visual indicators** -- hit = on track; missed = off track

### Types of Metrics to Include:

**Revenue/Financial:** Weekly revenue, Cash balance, AR over 60 days, Gross margin %
**Sales/Marketing:** New leads/week, Proposals sent, Close rate, CAC
**Operations:** On-time delivery rate, Error/defect rate, Capacity utilization, NPS
**People:** Open positions, Employee satisfaction pulse, Training completion rate

### Review Cadence:
- **Entered:** Weekly, before the L10 meeting
- **Reviewed:** Every L10 meeting during the 5-minute Scorecard section
- **Trailing view:** 4-week or 13-week intervals to spot trends
- **Off-track numbers** drop to the Issues List -- NOT discussed during Scorecard review

---

## 1.3 THE ROCKS SYSTEM (90-Day Priorities)

### Definition
Rocks are the 3-7 most important things that MUST get done in the next 90 days to move the company toward its vision. Named after Stephen Covey's "big rocks" analogy.

### Structure:
- **Company Rocks:** 3-7 priorities for the entire organization
- **Individual Rocks:** 3-7 per person on the leadership team
- **Departmental Rocks:** Cascade down -- department heads set Rocks for their teams

### SMART Rock Requirements:
1. **Specific outcome** -- not vague, clearly defined deliverable
2. **Measurable success criteria** -- binary: done or not done
3. **Single owner** -- one accountable person
4. **Realistic timeline** -- achievable within the 90-day window
5. **Clear connection to company goals** -- ties to V/TO vision

### Weekly Tracking (During L10 Meetings):
- Each person reports each Rock as **"On Track"** or **"Off Track"**
- No explanations needed if on track
- Off-track Rocks automatically become Issues for IDS
- The status is binary -- no "kind of on track"

### Milestones:
Each Rock should be broken into weekly milestones creating a definitive path to completion. If milestones are not being hit progressively, the Rock is OFF TRACK.

### Completion Targets:
- **80%+ Rock completion rate** across the team = healthy traction
- Below 80% = capacity issues or priority problems
- 100% is not the goal -- 80% keeps the bar realistic but high

### Setting Cadence:
- Rocks are SET during the quarterly meeting (full-day session)
- Process: Individual brainstorm (10 min) -> sharing (20 min) -> organizational Rock selection (30 min) -> individual assignment (20 min) -> documentation (10 min)

---

## 1.4 THE ISSUES SOLVING TRACK (IDS)

### The Three-Step Process:

#### STEP 1: IDENTIFY (The Root Cause)
- State the issue in one clear sentence
- If you cannot state it in one sentence, you have not identified it yet
- Ask "Why?" multiple times until you reach the ROOT cause
- ONE person states the issue. Everyone else listens.

#### STEP 2: DISCUSS (Open Dialogue)
- Everyone contributes relevant facts, data, and experience
- Rules: Leave egos at the door. Focus on the greater good. No tangents. Everyone's voice must be heard.
- Communication signals:
  - **Elephant in the Room** -- a major issue is being avoided
  - **Sacred Cow** -- challenge protected assumptions
  - **Squirrel** -- redirect when someone goes off-topic
  - **Dead Horse** -- topic has been discussed enough

#### STEP 3: SOLVE (Decide and Assign)
- Choose the BEST solution for the greater good
- Create specific To-Do items with: assigned single owner, 7-day deadline, clear definition of "done"
- Mark the issue as SOLVED and remove from list

### IDS Priority System:
1. Team reviews the full Issues List
2. Team votes on the TOP 3 most important issues
3. Issues are attacked in priority order, one at a time
4. Average resolution time: 10-20 minutes per issue
5. Teams typically solve 3-7 issues per 60-minute IDS block

### Three Types of Issues Lists:

| List Type | Reviewed When | Contains |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| **Long-Term Issues** | Quarterly and Annual meetings | Strategic, big-picture items for future quarters |
| **Short-Term Issues** | Weekly L10 meetings | Off-track Rocks, bad Scorecard numbers, client/people issues |
| **Departmental Issues** | Weekly department meetings | Tactical, team-level operational issues |

---

## 1.5 THE ACCOUNTABILITY CHART

### How It Differs from a Traditional Org Chart:

| Feature | Traditional Org Chart | EOS Accountability Chart |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Focus | Reporting relationships | Functions and accountabilities |
| Structure | Based on titles/positions | Based on seats with defined roles |
| Clarity | Shows who reports to whom | Shows who is accountable for what |
| Content | Names and titles only | 3-5 specific roles per seat |
| Ownership | Shared responsibility common | ONE person per accountability, always |

### The Default Structure (Top Level):

```
                    VISIONARY
                        |
                    INTEGRATOR
                        |
        --------------------------------
        |           |           |
    Sales/      Operations    Finance/
    Marketing                 Administration
```

### The Two Leadership Seats:

**VISIONARY:** Big-picture thinker, idea generator. Often the founder. Responsible for creative vision, key relationships, culture, big deals, R&D.

**INTEGRATOR:** Day-to-day operational leader. Runs the business, manages the leadership team. Responsible for harmonizing the team, executing the plan, P&L accountability.

### Three Core Functions (Every Business Has These):
1. **Sales & Marketing** -- generating leads and converting to customers
2. **Operations** -- delivering the product or service
3. **Finance & Administration** -- managing money, HR, IT, admin

### Seat Definition Rules:
- Each seat has **3-5 roles/bullet points** describing what that seat owns
- One person per seat (a person CAN sit in multiple seats, but each seat has only ONE person)

### The GWC Evaluation:
- **G -- Get It:** Does the person truly understand the role?
- **W -- Want It:** Does the person genuinely want to do this work?
- **C -- Capacity:** Does the person have the intellectual, physical, emotional, and time capacity?
- All three must be YES for a person to be in the right seat

### The People Analyzer (Core Values Evaluation):
- **+** = Consistently demonstrates this value
- **+/-** = Demonstrates about half the time
- **-** = Rarely demonstrates this value
- **The Bar:** Minimum 3 "+" and 2 "+/-" with ZERO "-" ratings

### Right Person, Right Seat:
- **Right Person** = Meets The Bar on Core Values
- **Right Seat** = Passes GWC for the seat they occupy
- Both must be true

## 1.10 COMMON FAILURES AND IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE

### The 12 Most Common Failures:

1. **Building Accountability Chart around people, not structure**
2. **Failing to implement unique ability properly**
3. **Thinking foundational tools are enough**
4. **Deprioritizing L10 Meetings** -- never cancel, never shorten, never change the agenda
5. **Not applying the 5 Leadership Abilities** (Simplify, Delegate, Predict, Systemize, Structure)
6. **Creating weak Scorecards** -- tracking lagging instead of leading indicators
7. **Neglecting team health and trust-building**
8. **Failing to master IDS** -- discussing without solving, or solving without identifying root cause
9. **Lack of full leadership team commitment** -- ONE uncommitted leader poisons the system
10. **Trying to implement everything at once**
11. **Skipping the Accountability Chart conversation**
12. **Not revisiting Accountability Chart during leadership changes**

### Implementation Timeline:

| Phase | Timeframe | Focus |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| **Phase 1: Foundation** | Months 1-3 | Rocks, L10 Meetings, Scorecard basics |
| **Phase 2: Vision & People** | Months 3-6 | V/TO, Accountability Chart, Core Values, People Analyzer |
| **Phase 3: Data & Process** | Months 6-12 | Scorecard refinement, Core Process documentation, IDS mastery |
| **Phase 4: Full Traction** | Months 12-18 | Full system cascaded to all departments |
| **Phase 5: Mastery** | Months 18-24+ | Continuous improvement, leadership development |

### Expected Results:
- **First 90 days:** Improved meeting discipline, clearer priorities
- **6 months:** Team alignment, accountability, faster issue resolution
- **12 months:** Measurable revenue, profit, and efficiency results
- **18 months:** Full system adoption across all departments
- **24 months:** Self-sustaining system, culture shift, consistent execution

### The 6 Key Components:

2. **People** (Accountability Chart, People Analyzer, GWC)
3. **Data** (Scorecard, Measurables)
4. **Issues** (IDS, Issues Lists)
5. **Process** (Core Process documentation, FBA)
6. **Traction** (Rocks, Meeting Pulse, To-Dos)

# 2. SCALING UP / ROCKEFELLER HABITS
<a name="2-scaling-up"></a>

*Source: "Scaling Up" by Verne Harnish (evolved from "Mastering the Rockefeller Habits")*

---

## 2.1 THE DAILY HUDDLE -- Complete Format

**Duration:** 5-15 minutes maximum (7 minutes typical for 8-person team)
**Frequency:** Every business day, same time
**Format:** Standing preferred (physically or virtually)
**Participants:** Every employee, organized by team level (cascading structure)

### Exact Agenda (3 Segments):

| Segment | Duration | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **1. What's Up** | ~2 min | Good news (personal/professional); what's on today's schedule for each team member |
| **2. Daily Metrics (Numbers)** | ~2 min | Quick report on team-level KPIs and activity metrics that are being tracked |
| **3. Stucks (Where Are You Stuck?)** | ~3 min | Bottlenecks, blockers, challenges needing attention. Issues NOT solved here -- flagged for follow-up offline or in weekly meeting |

### Cascading Huddle Structure:
```
8:00 AM -- Frontline team huddles (5-7 min each)
8:15 AM -- Middle management huddle (supervisors share stucks from their teams)
8:30 AM -- Executive team huddle (share aggregated stucks from all levels)
```

### Daily Huddle Rules:
- Same time, same place, every day
- Standing (no sitting)
- NO problem-solving -- only identifying stucks
- Anyone who has a stuck connects with relevant person AFTER the huddle
- Late arrivals are not accommodated -- starts on time regardless

**ROI:** Every minute in a daily huddle returns approximately 10 minutes of saved time throughout the day.

---

## 2.2 THE WEEKLY MEETING -- Full Agenda

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes (executive/management); 30 minutes (frontline teams)
**Frequency:** Same day, same time every week

### Exact Agenda with Time Allocations:

| Segment | Duration | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **1. Good News** | 5 min | Personal and professional good news. Creates positive energy and human connection. |
| **2. Review Priorities** | 10 min | Red/Yellow/Green status on quarterly company priorities. Identify gaps. Review metrics not covered in daily huddles. |
| **3. Customer & Employee Feedback** | 10 min | Report specific feedback from customers and employees collected during the week. Identify recurring issues. |
| **4. Collective Intelligence (Key Topics)** | 30-60 min | Deep dive into 1-2 topics needing the team's collective brainpower. Topics emerge from daily huddle patterns, priority gaps, feedback, or emerging threats/opportunities. |
| **5. Who-What-When (WWW)** | 5 min | Summarize all action items: WHO does WHAT by WHEN. Documented and distributed. |
| **6. One-Phrase Close** | 2 min | Each person gives a single word/phrase summarizing their reaction to the meeting. |

### Key Principles:
- First 25 minutes serve as a "warm-up" before collective intelligence
- Participants must come PREPARED with: results, KPI updates, Rock updates, priorities
- WWW list from prior week reviewed for accountability at start of next meeting

---

## 2.6 KPI TRACKING: SCALING UP vs. EOS

| Dimension | Scaling Up | EOS |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| **Number of Metrics** | Granular -- extensive KPIs across every role/function | Simplified -- 5-15 numbers on weekly Scorecard |
| **Tracking Mechanism** | Real-time dashboards; visual scoreboards "bigger than life" | Weekly Scorecard in L10 meeting |
| **Frequency** | Daily (huddle) + weekly + monthly/quarterly deep dives | Weekly in L10 meeting |
| **Individual Level** | Every employee has 1-2 KPIs + 1 Critical Number + 3-5 Rocks | Rocks quarterly; Scorecard numbers per seat |
| **Critical Number** | ONE overarching metric per quarter; changes quarterly | No direct equivalent; uses Rocks and Scorecard |
| **Customer Feedback** | Equal to financial data in frequency/rigor (Habit 6) | Not systematized at same frequency |
| **Employee Feedback** | Start/Stop/Keep conversations weekly (Habit 5) | Quarterly Conversations |
| **Cash Metrics** | Dedicated CASh tool + Power of One + Cash Conversion Cycle | Limited cash-specific tooling |
| **Scope** | 4 Decisions (People, Strategy, Execution, Cash) | 6 Key Components |

---

## 2.7 CRITICAL NUMBERS

### How Many:
- **ONE company-level Critical Number per quarter** (changes each quarter)
- **ONE individual Critical Number per employee** aligned with company's

### Two Categories:

**Category A -- People/Balance Sheet:** Employee turnover, customer service scores, credit line reduction, safety metrics, engagement scores

**Category B -- Process/P&L:** Gross margins, production cycle time, sales close ratios, cost per acquisition, average revenue per customer

**Selection Criterion:** What is the ONE metric that, if achieved this quarter, would have the greatest impact?

### How Tracked:
1. Quarterly Theme created (emotional, visual, memorable)
2. Scoreboard posted physically -- "bigger than life"
3. Weekly progress communicated to all employees
4. Pre-announced Celebration/Reward when achieved
5. Theme and Critical Number announced company-wide each quarter

---

## 2.8 THE WWW (WHO, WHAT, WHEN) ACCOUNTABILITY FORMAT

| WHO | WHAT | WHEN |
|-----|------|------|
| (Named person) | (Specific action/deliverable) | (Exact deadline date) |

### Rules:
- Every action item must have exactly ONE owner
- Deadlines are non-negotiable dates, not "ASAP"
- WWW list is the primary accountability mechanism between weekly meetings
- Items repeatedly carried over indicate a systemic issue

---

## 2.9 THE 7 STRATA OF STRATEGY

| Stratum | Name | Requirement |
|---------|------|------------|
| 1 | **Words You Own** | Choose 1-2 words to own in your marketplace |
| 2 | **Brand Promise** | List 10-12 marketplace wants; excel at max 3 |
| 3 | **Guarantee** | Put something painful at stake (catalytic mechanism) |
| 4 | **One-Phrase Strategy** | Sub-brand three promises into a single communicable phrase |
| 5 | **Differentiating Activities** | Operational actions competitors cannot easily copy |
| 6 | **X-Factor** | Underlying 10x-100x advantage over competition |
| 7 | **Profit per X and BHAG** | Single economic denominator tied to 10-25 year BHAG |

---

## 2.10 COMMON FAILURES AND IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE

### The 6 Most Common CEO Execution Mistakes:
1. **Lack of clear vision and goals** -- no SMART objectives
2. **Ineffective communication** -- no structured huddle/meeting rhythm
3. **Insufficient metrics and KPIs** -- can't measure progress
4. **Neglecting company culture** -- values erode while focusing on tactics
5. **Inadequate leadership development**
6. **Overlooking processes and systems** -- no PACe; bottlenecks compound

### Critical Foundation Failure:
**The #1 reason implementation fails is starting with the wrong habit.** Always start with Habit #1 (Executive Team Healthy and Aligned). Without trust and healthy debate at the top, every other habit fails.

### Implementation Timeline:

| Phase | Timeframe | What Happens |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| **Quick Wins** | 30-60 days | Daily huddles operational; alignment improves; communication gaps reduce |
| **Process Improvements** | 90-180 days | Weekly meetings driving accountability; first quarterly plan executed; KPIs tracked |
| **Capability Development** | 6-12 months | Full meeting rhythm; OPSP as living document; feedback loops operational |
| **Full Transformation** | 24-36 months | All 10 habits embedded; cascading scoreboards; culture shift visible; cash optimized |

### Recommended Implementation Sequence:
1. **Q1-2:** Habit 1 (Team Health) + Habit 3 (Meeting Rhythm)
2. **Q3-4:** Habit 2 (Critical Number/Rocks) + Habit 10 (Visible Scoreboards)
3. **Q5-6:** Habit 7 (Core Values) + Habit 4 (Accountability Charts)
4. **Q7-8:** Habit 5 (Employee Feedback) + Habit 6 (Customer Feedback)
5. **Q9-10:** Habit 8 (Strategy Articulation) + Habit 9 (Individual KPIs)

### Complete Meeting Rhythm Summary:

| Meeting | Duration | Frequency | Participants | Purpose |
|---------|----------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Daily Huddle** | 5-15 min | Every business day | All employees (cascading) | What's Up, Metrics, Stucks |
| **Weekly Meeting** | 60-90 min | Weekly | Exec team + dept heads | R/Y/G priorities, feedback, collective intelligence, WWW |
| **Bi-Weekly 1-on-1** | ~50 min | Every 2 weeks | Manager + direct report | Individual Rocks, coaching, Start/Stop/Keep |
| **Monthly Mgmt** | 4-8 hours | Monthly | All execs + all middle managers | Learning, DNA transfer, financial review, best practices |
| **Quarterly Planning** | 1-2 days | Every 90 days, offsite | Exec team + senior middle managers | Critical Number, Theme, Rocks, OPSP update |
| **Annual Planning** | 2-3 days, offsite | Annually | Full exec team + key leaders | Full OPSP review, BHAG, 3-5 year thrusts, annual goals |

# 3. THE 4 DISCIPLINES OF EXECUTION (4DX)
<a name="3-4dx"></a>

*Source: "The 4 Disciplines of Execution" by McChesney, Covey, Huling (FranklinCovey)*

---

## 3.1 DISCIPLINE 1: FOCUS ON THE WILDLY IMPORTANT GOAL (WIG)

### The WIG Limit Rule:

| Level | Maximum WIGs |
|-------|-------------|
| Organizational (top-level) | 1-2 WIGs, 3 at absolute maximum |
| Team level | No more than 2 WIGs per team |
| Individual | Should trace to team WIG |

### The Exact WIG Format:

```
FROM [X] TO [Y] BY [WHEN]
```

- **X** = Current state / baseline measurement
- **Y** = Target state / desired measurement
- **When** = Specific deadline

### WIG Format Rules:
1. Begin with a verb (increase, reduce, improve, grow)
2. Define the lag measure as "X to Y by [date]"
3. Keep it simple -- focus on WHAT, not HOW
4. Must be measurable with a clear numeric finish line
5. Must have a deadline

### WIG Examples:

| Function | WIG Statement |
|----------|--------------|
| Revenue | "Increase revenue from corporate events from $12M to $18M by December 31" |
| Customer Satisfaction | "Improve client satisfaction from 55% to 80% within 2 years" |
| Manufacturing | "Increase production from 45 to 50 million gallons annually by Q4" |
| Sales | "Grow quarterly revenue by 30% from $2M to $2.6M within 6 months" |
| HR | "Reduce employee turnover from 28% to 15% by end of fiscal year" |
| Cost | "Reduce operational costs from $4.2M to $3.5M by June 30" |

### Four Rules for Team WIG Selection:
1. **Quantity Limit:** No more than 2 WIGs per team
2. **Alignment:** Team WIGs must directly support organizational WIG
3. **Autonomy:** Teams choose their own WIGs; leaders can VETO but CANNOT DICTATE
4. **Format:** All WIGs must include "From (current) to (desired) by (deadline)"

---

## 3.2 DISCIPLINE 2: ACT ON LEAD MEASURES

### Lead vs. Lag Measures:

| | Lag Measures | Lead Measures |
|--|-------------|--------------|
| **Definition** | Results you are trying to achieve (the WIG itself) | Critical activities that drive the lag numbers |
| **Timing** | Measured AFTER the fact | Measured in real time (daily/weekly) |
| **Control** | Cannot directly influence once measured | Directly influenceable by team (80%+ control) |
| **Examples** | Revenue, profit, market share, NPS, turnover | Customer calls, training hours, maintenance checks |
| **Power** | Historical data | Predictive AND influenceable -- the leverage point |

### Two Types of Lead Measures:

**Type 1: Small Outcomes** -- Results-focused targets; teams achieve through flexible methods. Example: "Achieve 80% weekly customer satisfaction." Allows creative problem-solving.

**Type 2: Leveraged Behaviors** -- Specific behavioral patterns prescribed. Example: "Each team member helps at least 50 customers per week." Clear, repeatable, easy to track.

### Number Per WIG: 2-3 lead measures per WIG (no more than 6 total on scoreboard)

### Lead Measure Selection Criteria:

| Criterion | Test Question |
|-----------|--------------|
| Predictive | "Will this influence the lag measure / WIG?" |
| Influenceable | "Can our team directly control this?" |
| Maintainable | "Can this be sustained as an ongoing process?" |
| Team-driven | "Are results driven by the team, not just the leader?" |
| Measurable | "Can we track this with clear numeric metrics?" |
| Worth measuring | "Is the tracking effort justified by impact?" |

---

## 3.3 DISCIPLINE 3: KEEP A COMPELLING SCOREBOARD

### Player's Scoreboard (CORRECT) vs. Coach's Scoreboard (WRONG):

**Player's Scoreboard:**
- Simple, visual graphs showing only essential information
- EMPLOYEES update and maintain it themselves
- Anyone can understand it in seconds
- Shows only: where you are and where you need to be

### Four Required Characteristics:

1. **SIMPLICITY** -- Minimal information only; easy to update even when busy
2. **VISIBILITY** -- Positioned where team sees it constantly; public display increases accountability
3. **COMPLETENESS** -- Displays BOTH WIG (lag) AND lead measures; shows current vs. target
4. **QUICK READABILITY (5-Second Test)** -- Anyone can determine in 5 seconds if winning or losing

### Recommended Chart Types:

| Chart Type | Best For |
|-----------|---------|
| Trend Lines | Lag measures -- where you're supposed to be vs. where you are |
| Bar Charts | Comparing individuals/teams on lead measures |
| Andon Charts | Lead measures -- smiley/sad faces, green/red dots |
| Common Gauges | Time-based metrics -- speedometers, thermometers |

### Who Updates: **THE PLAYERS (EMPLOYEES) -- NOT THE LEADER**

---

## 3.4 DISCIPLINE 4: CREATE A CADENCE OF ACCOUNTABILITY

### The WIG Session Parameters:

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|
| Duration | 20-30 minutes maximum |
| Frequency | At least weekly; same day, same time |
| Attendance | ALL team members; mandatory, no exceptions |
| Agenda | Fixed 3-part structure; never deviate |
| Whirlwind | NEVER discussed in a WIG session |
| Sanctity | "Must be considered sacred" -- never cancel |

---

## 3.5 THE WEEKLY WIG SESSION -- MINUTE-BY-MINUTE

### The Three-Part Agenda:

#### PART 1: ACCOUNT (Report on Last Week's Commitments) -- ~1-2 min/person

Each team member reports:
```
"Last week I committed to [specific action].
I [did / did not] complete it.
[Result / what I learned / what blocked me]."
```

**Rules:** No justifications. Leader reports FIRST (models accountability). Failed commitments from two consecutive weeks should be replaced.

#### PART 2: REVIEW THE SCOREBOARD -- ~3-5 minutes total

The team evaluates:
1. Are lead measures moving? (Right activities?)
2. Are lead measures moving the lag measure? (Is it working?)
3. What's working well? (Celebrate and replicate)
4. What's not working? (Identify and adjust)

#### PART 3: PLAN / COMMIT (New Commitments) -- ~1-2 min/person

Each person answers:
> **"What are the one or two most important things I can do THIS WEEK that will have the biggest impact on the scoreboard?"**

```
"This week I commit to [specific, measurable action]
which will impact [lead measure name]."
```

### Complete WIG Session Timeline (8-person team):

| Time | Activity | Who |
|------|----------|-----|
| 0:00-0:02 | Leader reports on own commitments | Leader |
| 0:02-0:14 | Each member reports on commitments (~1.5 min each) | All |
| 0:14-0:19 | Review scoreboard together; discuss trends | All |
| 0:19-0:20 | Acknowledge wins, identify support needs | Leader |
| 0:20-0:22 | Leader makes new commitment | Leader |
| 0:22-0:28 | Each member makes new commitment (~1 min each) | All |
| 0:28-0:30 | Close; confirm all commitments recorded | Leader |

### The 80/20 Whirlwind Rule:

| Allocation | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **80%** of team time and energy | Sustaining the whirlwind (day-to-day operations) |
| **20%** of team time and energy | Focused, protected time on the WIG |

---

---

## 3.7 IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE AND COMMON FAILURES

### The 5 Stages:

| Stage | Timeline | What Happens |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **1. Getting Clear** | 2-4 weeks | WIGs developed; lead measures identified; scoreboard designed |
| **2. Launch** | Weeks 1-4 | First WIG sessions; scoreboard goes live. **Most failures happen here.** |
| **3. Adoption** | Weeks 5-12 | New behaviors drive WIG achievement; peer accountability develops |
| **4. Optimization** | Weeks 13-24+ | Significant performance improvements; team starts optimizing |
| **5. Habits** | Month 6+ | 4DX is habitual; superior results consistent; transition to new WIGs |

### 12 Common Failures:
1. Too many WIGs (diluted focus)
2. Treating 4DX as training program, not operating system
3. Picking non-strategic WIGs
4. Only leveraged behavior lead measures (no small outcomes)
5. Using scoreboard to shame
6. Top-down enforcement vs. peer accountability
7. Allowing whirlwind into WIG sessions
8. Skipping/inconsistent WIG sessions
9. Training leaders at wrong org level
10. Insufficient internal coaching (need 2+ coaches)
11. Uncommitted senior leadership
12. Focusing on lag instead of lead measures

# 4. OKRs FOR SMBs (Objectives and Key Results)
<a name="4-okrs"></a>

*Source: "Measure What Matters" by John Doerr + SMB-specific implementation research*

---

## 4.1 OKR STRUCTURE FOR SMBs (<$5M Revenue)

### Recommended OKR Counts Per Level:

| Level | Objectives | Key Results per Objective |
|-------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Company | 3-5 per quarter | 3-5 per objective |
| Department/Team | 2-3 per quarter | 2-4 per objective |
| Individual | 1-3 per quarter | 2-3 per objective |

### SMB-Specific Adaptations:
- Start with company-level OKRs ONLY for first 1-2 quarters
- Add team-level OKRs in quarter 3
- Add individual OKRs only after team OKRs work well
- **67% of companies still use spreadsheets** as primary tracking tool

### OKR Format:

**Objective:** Qualitative, inspirational, time-bound. "Where do I want to go?"
**Key Result:** Quantitative, measurable, verifiable. "How will I know I'm getting there?"

### Example:
```
OBJECTIVE: Become the most trusted provider in our market

Key Result 1: Increase NPS from 42 to 65
Key Result 2: Achieve 95% customer retention rate (currently 87%)
Key Result 3: Generate 15 customer case studies/testimonials (currently 3)
```

---

## 4.2 SCORING METHODOLOGY (0-1.0 Scale)

### The Decimal Scoring System:

| Score | Percentage | Color | Meaning | Action |
|-------|-----------|-------|---------|--------|
| 0.7-1.0 | 70-100% | GREEN | On track; strategies working | Continue and replicate |
| 0.4-0.6 | 40-60% | YELLOW | At risk; may need adjustment | Investigate and adjust |
| 0.0-0.3 | 0-30% | RED | Likely won't meet KRs | Significant intervention |

### Calculating Overall OKR Score:
- Take the **average score** of all Key Results
- Each KR counts equally
- Example: KRs scoring 0.9, 0.5, 0.5 = average of **0.63**

### Committed vs. Aspirational OKRs:

**Committed OKRs:**
- Pass/fail -- score of 1.0 (100%) required
- No middle ground; failure requires immediate post-mortem

**Aspirational OKRs (Stretch Goals):**
- 70% completion = success
- Below 30% average = goals too ambitious
- At 70% average = sufficiently bold
- Consistently above 100% = sandbagging

---

## 4.3 THE OKR CYCLE (Quarterly)

### Four Phases:

**Phase 1: Pre-Quarter (4-6 weeks before)**
- Senior leadership builds top-level OKRs
- Identify OKR champions; prepare infrastructure

**Phase 2: Start of Quarter (2 weeks before - Week 1)**
- Share top-level OKRs company-wide
- Departments/teams/individuals develop their own OKRs
- Vertical alignment (team to company) and horizontal alignment (cross-team)

**Phase 3: During Quarter (Weeks 1-12)**
- Weekly check-ins; confidence assessments
- Data-driven monitoring and adjustments

**Phase 4: End of Quarter (1-3 weeks before end)**
- OKR retrospective at all levels
- Analyze scores; reflect on underperformance
- Set OKRs for upcoming quarter

---

## 4.4 WEEKLY CHECK-IN FORMAT

**Duration:** 15 minutes
**Frequency:** Weekly

### Agenda:
1. Update all Key Results with latest metrics
2. Confidence Rating (High/Medium/Low) from each owner
3. Progress vs. Target -- are we on track?
4. Blockers -- what's preventing progress?
5. Plan for this week -- what will move the needle?

**Key Statistic:** Teams with weekly OKR reviews achieve **43% higher goal completion rates**

---

## 4.5 MONTHLY REVIEW FORMAT

**Duration:** 60 minutes

| Step | Activity | Focus |
|------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Review KRs individually | Progress vs. target, confidence, risks |
| 2 | Assess status | Red/Yellow/Green system |
| 3 | Identify blockers | Internal vs. external causes |
| 4 | Root cause analysis | "5 Whys" technique |
| 5 | Adjust KRs if needed | Modify targets or replace goals |
| 6 | Reallocate resources | Shift support to at-risk priorities |
| 7 | Document outcomes | Share recap and next steps |

---

## 4.6 ALIGNMENT AND CASCADING

### Vertical: Company OKRs -> Team OKRs -> Individual OKRs
### Horizontal: Cross-team dependencies; shared Key Results

**Critical Stat:** 65% of teams admit their OKRs aren't linked to company goals

### SMB Alignment Process:
1. CEO/founder sets company OKRs
2. Department leads propose supporting team OKRs
3. CEO and leads review together for alignment
4. Individual contributors set personal OKRs
5. Cross-team dependencies identified and shared KRs created

---

## 4.7 CROSS-FUNCTIONAL MEETING CADENCE

### Bi-Weekly Alternating Format:

**Execution Meeting (Weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13):**
- Top 3 priorities for next 2 weeks
- Review previous 2-week commitments
- "Any other topic" (max 3)

**OKR Progress Meeting (Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12):**
- Review OKR progress
- Discuss blockers
- "Any other topic" (max 3)

---

## 4.8 COMMON FAILURES FOR SMBs

1. **Too many OKRs** -- start with 3-5 company OKRs
2. **Confusing tasks with Key Results** -- KRs are outcomes, not to-do items
3. **Setting "sandbag" goals** -- aspirational should target ~70% success
4. **No weekly check-ins** -- 43% higher completion with weekly reviews
5. **Tying OKRs to compensation** -- OKRs should NOT be performance reviews
6. **Top-down only** -- 60% should be set bottom-up for ownership
7. **Abandoning after one quarter** -- teams with 5+ cycles complete 20% more
8. **No single owner per KR** -- clear ownership improves results 26%
9. **Skipping the retrospective** -- end-of-cycle reviews = 30-45% more objectives
10. **Using only annual OKRs** -- quarterly provides faster feedback

---

## 4.9 KEY OKR STATISTICS

- **54%** see measurable impact within 3 months
- **60% higher revenue growth** with well-implemented OKRs
- **68%** of startups say OKRs helped reach $1M ARR faster
- **72%** of OKR employees understand company vision (vs. 50% without)
- **78%** report higher job satisfaction
- **83%** report positive benefits
- **2.5-4x faster growth** for well-implemented OKR companies

---

## 4.10 IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE FOR SMBs

| Phase | Timeframe | Focus |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| **Pilot** | Quarter 1 | Company-level OKRs only; leadership learns |
| **Expand** | Quarter 2 | Refine; add team-level OKRs |
| **Cascade** | Quarter 3-4 | Add individual OKRs; cross-team alignment |
| **Optimize** | Quarter 5+ | Full cadence; scoring/retrospectives refined |
| **Mastery** | Year 2+ | OKRs embedded in culture; 70%+ aspirational completion |

# 5. THE GREAT GAME OF BUSINESS (GGOB)
<a name="5-ggob"></a>

*Source: "The Great Game of Business" by Jack Stack + "A Stake in the Outcome"*

---

## 5.1 THE HUDDLE SYSTEM

### Tier 1: DAILY DEPARTMENTAL HUDDLES

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Duration** | 5-10 minutes |
| **Frequency** | Every business day |
| **Participants** | Department/team level |
| **Purpose** | Review daily metrics, surface issues, quick alignment |

**Agenda:**
1. Review key departmental numbers (daily metrics)
2. Report progress on Critical Number drivers
3. Surface any issues or blockers
4. Quick wins and acknowledgments

### Tier 2: WEEKLY MAIN HUDDLE (Company-Wide)

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Duration** | 30-60 minutes |
| **Frequency** | Weekly |
| **Participants** | Entire company (or reps from all departments) |
| **Purpose** | Review full financial statements, track Critical Number, update forecasts |

**Agenda:**
1. Each department reports numbers against forecast
2. Review full income statement -- line by line
3. Review balance sheet key items
4. Update the financial forecast
5. Track Critical Number and bonus progress
6. Celebrate wins and MiniGame progress
7. Q&A -- any employee can ask about the numbers

### Financial Forecasting as Commitment:
- Projections treated as binding promises
- Deviations >5% below projections require "a rational explanation"
- Forecasts updated WEEKLY, not monthly

### Scoreboard Requirements:
- **Mural-sized wall charts** in cafeterias and common areas
- Income/expense breakdowns, plant efficiency, product composition
- **Updated daily** -- real-time visibility

---

## 5.2 THE CRITICAL NUMBER

### Definition:
The ONE metric that, if improved, would have the greatest impact. Drives the entire company's focus.

### Selection:
- Review vital financial ratios every six months
- Compare company measurements with marketplace benchmarks
- Target the company's weakest area
- Changes semi-annually or quarterly

### Categories:

**Balance Sheet Side:** Cash reserves, debt reduction, inventory turns, turnover, safety, retention

**Income Statement Side:** Gross margins, revenue per employee, cost reduction, conversion, efficiency

### How It Connects to Individual Actions:
Through **Drivers** -- "the specific strategies that could be acted on to directly affect the Critical Number."

**Line of Sight:** "A clear, unobstructed view to a target" connecting daily decisions to financial goals.

### Driver Identification:
- Participatory, not top-down
- Each department identifies its own Drivers
- Core principle: **"People support what they help create"**

---

## 5.3 THE MINIGAME FRAMEWORK

### Structure:

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Duration** | 60-90 days (never longer) |
| **Scope** | One specific, measurable improvement target |
| **Team** | Department or cross-functional team |
| **Scoreboard** | Visible, physical, updated by employees |
| **Prize/Reward** | Pre-announced reward when goal is hit |
| **Connection** | Must tie to Critical Number or key financial metric |

### Design Steps:
1. Identify the target metric
2. Set a measurable 60-90 day goal
3. Design the scoreboard (fun, visible)
4. Announce the prize
5. Launch with energy (kick-off meeting)
6. Track weekly in huddles
7. Celebrate completion publicly

### Examples:
- Reduce AR by $50K in 60 days
- Zero safety incidents for 90 days
- Reduce waste from 5% to 2% in 60 days
- Increase cross-sell rate by 15% in 90 days

---

## 5.4 OPEN-BOOK MANAGEMENT

### Three Core Principles:
1. **Know and Teach the Rules** -- Every employee learns financials
2. **Follow the Action and Keep Score** -- Real-time scoreboards; everyone sees CEO-level numbers
3. **Provide a Stake in the Outcome** -- Bonuses, profit-sharing, ESOP

### Financial Literacy Training:
- Income statements, balance sheets, cash flow, margins, ratios
- Integrated into onboarding + reinforced weekly through huddles
- Goal: Every employee explains how their job affects financial performance

### What Gets Shared:
- Full income statement (revenue, COGS, expenses, profit)
- Key balance sheet items (cash, AR, AP, debt, equity)
- Cash flow statements
- Budget vs. actual variances
- Forecasts (updated weekly by line-item owners)

---

## 5.5 THE BONUS/PROFIT-SHARING PROGRAM

### Self-Funding Gain-Share Model:

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Funding Source** | Self-funding -- pays for itself through improved performance |
| **Split** | 50/50 -- 50 cents to bonus pool, 50 cents back to company |
| **Hourly/Non-Exempt Max** | 13% of annual salary |
| **Manager Max** | 18% of annual salary |
| **Self-Funding Rate** | ~90% of the time |

### How It Works:
1. Review vital financial ratios every six months
2. Compare with marketplace benchmarks
3. Tie bonus programs to areas of weakness
4. When company hits targets, every employee gets paid
5. Employees can forecast their own bonus weekly (numbers visible)

### Compensation Hierarchy During Downturns:
1. Bonuses cut first
2. ESOP payments follow
3. Salaries reduced third
4. Layoffs as absolute last resort

### ESOP:
- Nearly all employees own shares
- Retirement tied to company success
- Stock buybacks during profitable periods
- Separate 401(k) for diversification (10% annual savings recommended)

## 5.6 THE HIGHER LAWS OF BUSINESS (Jack Stack's Principles)

1. **You Get What You Give** -- Share knowledge, employees share effort
2. **It's Easy to Stop One Guy, But Hard to Stop 100** -- Distribute knowledge widely
3. **What Goes Around Comes Around** -- Transparency breeds trust breeds performance
4. **You Do What You Gotta Do** -- Creative solutions over cutting people
5. **You Gotta Wanna** -- People must choose to engage
6. **You Can Never Fool the Players** -- Employees know when numbers are hidden
7. **Appeal to Highest Thinking = Highest Performance** -- Treat people as business partners
8. **When People Set Own Targets, They Hit Them** -- Participatory goal-setting
9. **If Nobody Pays Attention, People Stop Caring** -- Visible scoreboards + weekly huddles
10. **As You Teach, You Learn** -- Financial literacy benefits teachers too

---

## 5.7 CADENCE SUMMARY

### Daily:
- Departmental huddles (5-10 min) -- daily metrics and Driver progress
- Scoreboard updates (mural-sized wall charts updated daily)

### Weekly:
- Company-wide main huddle (30-60 min)
- Full financial statement review line by line
- Forecast updates; Critical Number and bonus tracking
- MiniGame scoreboard updates

### Monthly:
- Financial close and variance analysis
- Detailed budget vs. actual review
- Critical Number progress assessment

### Quarterly:
- Bonus payout when targets hit
- "Game Day" company-wide celebration
- Review/reset Critical Number
- New MiniGames launched
- Financial literacy reinforcement

### Annual:
- Annual game plan with monthly financial targets
- Full financial health review
- Critical Number selection for the year
- "Game Health Audit" -- metrics, culture, outcomes
- Bonus structure review
- ESOP valuation and distribution

## 5.8 COMMON FAILURES

1. **Not investing in financial literacy training** -- open books useless if unreadable
2. **Half-hearted transparency** -- sharing some numbers but hiding others
3. **No visible scoreboards** -- invisible goals = forgotten goals
4. **Tying bonuses to things employees can't influence** -- need line of sight
5. **Skipping the huddle system** -- engagement drops without weekly reviews
6. **Making it a "program" not a culture** -- requires permanent transparency commitment
7. **CEO not participating in huddles** -- if CEO doesn't show, nobody cares
8. **Overly complex financial sharing** -- start simple, build complexity
9. **No celebration/reward** -- removing prize removes motivation
10. **Not connecting individual actions to financial outcomes** -- Drivers must be per department
