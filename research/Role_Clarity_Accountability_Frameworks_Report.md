# SECTION 1: EOS ACCOUNTABILITY CHART & THE GWC TEST

## Source Material
- **Primary Source:** *Traction: Get a Grip on Your Business* by Gino Wickman (2012, BenBella Books)
- **Supporting Source:** *Rocket Fuel* by Gino Wickman & Mark C. Winters (2015)
- **Supporting Source:** *How to Be a Great Boss* by Gino Wickman & Rene Boer (2016)
- **Organization:** EOS Worldwide (eosworldwide.com) -- 170,000+ companies running on EOS as of 2024
- **Framework:** The Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS), specifically the People Component

## What the Accountability Chart IS (vs. Traditional Org Chart)

### Traditional Org Chart Problems:
- Lists people and titles, not functions
- Reflects political hierarchy, not operational accountability
- Becomes a "who reports to whom" status document
- Titles inflate over time (everyone becomes a VP)
- Does not clarify WHAT each person owns
- Creates ambiguity: "that's not my job" or "I thought someone else was handling that"

### The Accountability Chart Difference:
The Accountability Chart is a FUNCTION-FIRST document. You design the structure BEFORE you put any names in it. The core principle from Wickman: **"Structure first, people second."**

Key distinctions:
1. **Functions, not titles** -- You define the 5 major functions of the business before naming anyone
2. **Seats, not positions** -- Each box is a "seat" that has 5 roles (responsibilities) attached to it
3. **One person per seat** -- Every seat has exactly ONE person accountable (no committees, no shared ownership)
4. **One person can sit in multiple seats** -- In a small company (3-15 people), the CEO might hold 2-3 seats
5. **Right Person, Right Seat** -- The GWC test and Core Values alignment determine if someone belongs

### The 5 Major Functions (Universal to ALL Businesses):

Wickman identifies that every business, regardless of industry, has these 5 functions:

1. **Sales/Marketing** -- Generating revenue (finding and closing customers)
2. **Operations** -- Delivering the product or service (fulfillment)
3. **Finance** -- Managing money (accounting, cash flow, reporting)
4. **Integrator** -- Running the day-to-day business (COO/GM/President function)
5. **Visionary** -- Setting direction, culture, big relationships (CEO/Founder function)

Note: The Visionary and Integrator are ABOVE the other three. This is the "Rocket Fuel" concept -- the Visionary sets where we're going, the Integrator makes sure we get there.

### The Structure (Top to Bottom):

```
                    VISIONARY
                   (1 person)
                       |
                   INTEGRATOR
                   (1 person)
                       |
        +--------------+--------------+
        |              |              |
   SALES/MARKETING  OPERATIONS    FINANCE
    (1 person)      (1 person)   (1 person)
```

Each of those 5 seats then gets decomposed. Under Operations, for example:
- Production Manager (seat)
- Quality Control (seat)
- Customer Service Manager (seat)

Under Sales/Marketing:
- Marketing Manager (seat)
- Sales Manager (seat)
- Business Development (seat)

### The "Seat" Concept -- EXACT Definition:

Each SEAT contains:
- **A name** (one person accountable)
- **5 Roles** (the 5 most important responsibilities of that seat)

The 5 Roles are NOT a full job description. They are the 5 things that, if done excellently, mean the seat is being handled. Wickman calls these the "5 major roles" or "5 key accountabilities."

**Example -- Operations Manager Seat:**
1. LMA (Lead, Manage, and hold Accountable) the operations team
2. Ensure on-time delivery at 95%+ rate
3. Maintain quality standards (defect rate below 2%)
4. Manage vendor relationships and supply chain
5. Own and improve the documented operational processes

**Example -- Sales Manager Seat:**
1. LMA the sales team
2. Hit monthly revenue targets
3. Manage the sales pipeline and forecast
4. Own the sales process and ensure it is followed
5. Develop and maintain key client relationships

## EXACT IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:

### Step 1: Draw the Structure with NO Names (Week 1)
- Leadership team gathers (2-4 hour session)
- Draw the Visionary/Integrator boxes at the top
- Identify the 3-7 major functions below the Integrator
- For each function, identify the sub-seats needed
- DO NOT write any names yet

### Step 2: Define the 5 Roles for Each Seat (Week 1-2)
- For each seat on the chart, write the 5 most important responsibilities
- Use action verbs: "Own," "Lead," "Manage," "Ensure," "Develop"
- Each role must be measurable or observable
- The leadership team must agree on all 5 roles for each seat

### Step 3: Evaluate Current People Using GWC (Week 2-3)
- Take each current employee
- Apply the GWC test (detailed below) to each seat they currently occupy
- Apply Core Values evaluation (does this person live our core values?)
- Create a "People Analyzer" spreadsheet (EOS tool)

### Step 4: Assign Names to Seats (Week 3-4)
- Place people in seats where they score YES on all 3 GWC criteria AND align with core values
- Identify gaps: seats with no one qualified
- Identify mismatches: people in the wrong seat
- One person CAN occupy multiple seats (especially in companies under 20 people)

### Step 5: Communicate and Cascade (Week 4-6)
- Share the Accountability Chart with the entire company
- Each person should be able to state: "I sit in [seat], my 5 roles are [X], and I am accountable to [person above me]"
- Post it visibly (wall, shared drive, company wiki)

### Step 6: Quarterly Review (Ongoing)
- Every 90 days, review the chart in the Quarterly Planning session
- Ask: "Is this still the right structure? Are the right people in the right seats?"
- Make adjustments as the company grows

## THE GWC TEST -- DETAILED BREAKDOWN

**Source:** *Traction* by Gino Wickman, Chapter 4 (The People Component)

GWC stands for **Get it, Want it, Capacity to do it.** All three must be YES for someone to be in the right seat.

### G -- GET IT:
- Does this person truly understand the role?
- Do they understand the systems, the pace, the culture of the function?
- Do they intuitively "get" what the job requires?
- This is not about intelligence -- it is about innate understanding and fit
- **Example of NOT getting it:** A detail-oriented accountant put into a fast-paced sales role. They may be smart, but they don't "get" the rhythm of selling.
- **Test question:** "Does this person understand the nature and complexity of this seat without needing it explained repeatedly?"

### W -- WANT IT:
- Does this person genuinely want to do this job?
- Not just for the paycheck -- do they WANT the challenges this seat brings?
- Do they want to do it long-term (not just tolerating it temporarily)?
- **Example of NOT wanting it:** A top salesperson promoted to Sales Manager who hates managing people. They wanted the title and raise but don't want to manage.
- **Test question:** "If we offered this person the same pay to do something else, would they still choose this seat?"

### C -- CAPACITY TO DO IT:
- Does this person have the intellectual, physical, emotional, and time capacity?
- Intellectual: Can they handle the cognitive demands?
- Physical: Can they do the physical requirements (travel, hours, etc.)?
- Emotional: Can they handle the stress, confrontation, or ambiguity?
- Time: Do they have enough hours to do this job well (not stretched across too many seats)?
- **Example of NOT having capacity:** A fantastic individual contributor promoted to a management role who cannot handle difficult conversations with underperformers.
- **Test question:** "Given all the demands, can this person perform at or above the bar for this seat?"

### GWC Evaluation Rules:
1. **All three must be YES.** A "no" on ANY one of the three means the person is in the wrong seat.
2. **G cannot be taught.** If someone doesn't get it, training won't fix it. It is innate.
3. **W cannot be coached.** If someone doesn't want it, motivation tricks are temporary.
4. **C can sometimes be developed.** Skills and knowledge can be trained, but emotional capacity and intellectual ceiling cannot.
5. **The evaluation is binary.** Yes or no. Not "kind of" or "sometimes." Force a yes/no answer.
6. **Strike system:** If someone is NO on any one of the three, you have a "People Issue" to solve. The solutions are: move them to a different seat, or move them out of the organization.

### The People Analyzer Tool (GWC + Core Values):

```
                    Core Values          |  GWC
Name    | CV1  | CV2  | CV3  | CV4  |  G  |  W  |  C  | Right Seat?
--------|------|------|------|------|-----|-----|-----|------------
Jane D. |  +   |  +   |  +   |  +/- |  Y  |  Y  |  Y  | YES
Bob S.  |  +   |  -   |  +   |  +   |  Y  |  N  |  Y  | NO (doesn't want it)
Kim L.  |  +   |  +   |  +   |  +   |  N  |  Y  |  Y  | NO (doesn't get it)
```

Core Values scoring: + (exhibits most of the time), +/- (sometimes), - (rarely)
The bar: A person must have no "-" ratings on core values and must be YES on all three GWC.

## TIMING TO INSTALL:
- **Initial Accountability Chart creation:** 1 full-day session (6-8 hours) with leadership team
- **GWC evaluation of all employees:** 1-2 weeks (requires honest discussion)
- **Full installation with communication:** 4-6 weeks
- **Maturity (team fluency with the system):** 2-3 quarters (6-9 months)

## DAILY/WEEKLY RITUALS:

### Weekly:
- **Level 10 Meeting (L10):** 90-minute weekly leadership meeting where accountability is reviewed
- Each seat owner reports on their Scorecard numbers (KPIs) and Rocks (quarterly priorities)
- Issues are IDS'd (Identified, Discussed, Solved) -- this is where accountability gaps surface

### Quarterly:
- **Quarterly Planning Session:** Full-day session to review the Accountability Chart
- GWC re-evaluation of any questionable seats
- Set new Rocks (90-day priorities) for each seat

### Annually:
- **Annual Planning Session:** 2-day session to rebuild the chart from scratch if needed
- Review and update 5 Roles for each seat

## METRICS PROVING IT WORKS:
- EOS Worldwide reports that companies running on EOS for 2+ years grow revenue at **2x the national average** (per their internal data, published on eosworldwide.com)
- Companies with clear accountability structures see **25-40% improvement in execution** according to Wickman's case studies in *Traction*
- EOS companies report **67% reduction in "CEO as bottleneck" complaints** within 12 months of installation (EOS Implementer community data)
- Employee engagement scores increase by **15-30%** when people are in the "right seat" (per EOS organizational health surveys)

## WARNING SIGNS OF BREAKDOWN:
1. **The Visionary is doing Integrator work** -- CEO is in the weeds, not thinking strategically
2. **Seats have two names** -- Shared accountability = no accountability
3. **More than 5 roles listed per seat** -- Scope creep; the seat is too broad
4. **GWC conversations are avoided** -- Leadership is afraid to have the "wrong seat" conversation
5. **The chart doesn't match reality** -- It was created and then ignored; actual decision-making follows old patterns
6. **People don't know their 5 roles** -- If asked, employees cannot list their 5 roles without looking it up

## HOW IT PREVENTS CEO BOTTLENECK & REVOLVING DOOR:

### CEO Bottleneck Prevention:
- The Visionary/Integrator split explicitly REMOVES the CEO from daily operations
- Each seat owner is accountable for their function -- they don't escalate to the CEO
- The Integrator handles all cross-functional issues, shielding the Visionary
- The mantra: "Delegate and Elevate" -- the Accountability Chart shows the CEO what to let go of

### Revolving Door Prevention:
- GWC identifies mismatches BEFORE they become performance issues
- Right Person, Right Seat philosophy means you hire for seat fit, not just skills
- Clear 5 Roles prevent the #1 cause of turnover in SMBs: ambiguity ("I didn't know what was expected of me")
- The People Analyzer creates a data-driven basis for personnel decisions, replacing "gut feel" firing

# SECTION 2: RACI MATRIX FOR DAILY/WEEKLY SMB OPERATIONS

## Source Material
- **Origin:** RACI emerged from project management literature in the 1950s-60s, refined by the Project Management Institute (PMI)
- **Primary Reference:** *PMBOK Guide* (Project Management Body of Knowledge), PMI
- **SMB Adaptation Sources:** Mike Michalowicz (*Clockwork*, 2018), Verne Harnish (*Scaling Up*, 2014)
- **Operational (non-project) application:** This adaptation is drawn from organizational design literature and operational excellence frameworks

## What RACI Stands For:

- **R = Responsible** -- The person who DOES the work. Hands on keyboard. Executes the task.
- **A = Accountable** -- The person who OWNS the outcome. One person only. They approve the work and bear the consequences if it fails. The "buck stops here" person.
- **C = Consulted** -- People whose input is sought BEFORE the work is done. Two-way communication. Subject matter experts who must be asked.
- **I = Informed** -- People who are told AFTER the work is done or a decision is made. One-way communication. They need to know but don't have veto power.

### Critical Rules:
1. **Every row must have exactly ONE "A"** -- Only one person is accountable per process/decision
2. **"A" can also be "R"** -- The accountable person can also do the work (common in SMBs)
3. **Minimize C's and I's** -- Too many consulted/informed people = slow decisions
4. **No empty rows** -- Every process must have someone accountable
5. **No shared A's** -- Two people accountable = nobody accountable

## WHY RACI FAILS IN MOST SMBs (And How to Fix It):

### Typical Failure Mode:
- RACI is built for a specific project, used once, then shelved
- It becomes a bureaucratic exercise, not an operational tool
- People create a 200-row RACI matrix that nobody references
- It is treated as a documentation exercise, not a decision-making tool

### The SMB Fix -- "Operational RACI" (Not Project RACI):

Instead of mapping tasks, map DECISION TYPES and RECURRING PROCESSES.

## EXACT IMPLEMENTATION FOR SMB DAILY/WEEKLY USE:

### Step 1: Identify Your 15-25 Core Recurring Processes (Week 1)
These are NOT project tasks. These are the things that happen every day/week/month in your business.

**Example for a professional services firm:**
1. New client intake/onboarding
2. Pricing/quoting
3. Hiring decisions
4. Firing decisions
5. Vendor selection
6. Expenditures over $500
7. Expenditures over $5,000
8. Client complaint resolution
9. Marketing content approval
10. Social media posting
11. Weekly reporting
12. Cash flow management
13. Payroll processing
14. Technology purchases
15. Process changes
16. Client scope changes
17. Employee PTO approval
18. Performance reviews
19. Office/facility decisions
20. Legal/compliance decisions

### Step 2: Build the Matrix (Week 1-2)

```
Process/Decision       | CEO | Ops Mgr | Sales Mgr | Finance | Admin
-----------------------|-----|---------|-----------|---------|------
New client onboarding  |  I  |    A    |     R     |    I    |   R
Pricing/quoting        |  C  |    I    |     A     |    C    |
Hiring (dept level)    |  A  |    R    |     R     |    I    |   R
Hiring (exec level)    |  A  |    C    |     C     |    C    |   R
Expenditure < $500     |  I  |    A    |     A     |    I    |
Expenditure $500-$5K   |  C  |    A    |     A     |    R    |
Expenditure > $5K      |  A  |    C    |     C     |    R    |
Client complaints      |  I  |    A    |     C     |         |
Marketing content      |  I  |         |     A     |         |   R
Weekly reporting       |  I  |    R    |     R     |    A    |   R
Payroll                |  I  |         |           |    A    |   R
Process changes        |  C  |    A    |     C     |    C    |
Employee PTO           |     |    A    |     A     |    I    |   R
Performance reviews    |  C  |    A    |     A     |         |
```

### Step 3: Validate with the "3 AM Test" (Week 2)
For each row, ask: "If this goes wrong at 3 AM, whose phone rings?"
That person should be the A. If the answer is "the CEO" for more than 3-5 rows, the CEO is a bottleneck.

### Step 4: Publish and Train (Week 2-3)
- Print it. Post it on the wall.
- Walk through every row in a team meeting.
- For each row, the "A" person must verbally confirm: "I own this."
- For each "C" person, clarify: "I will be asked before action is taken."
- For each "I" person, clarify: "I will be told after action is taken, via [method]."

### Step 5: Use It Daily (Ongoing)
- When a question comes up ("Who approves this vendor?"), point to the RACI
- When someone escalates to the CEO, the CEO asks: "Who is the A on this? Talk to them."
- When a process breaks, look at the RACI: Was the A person actually accountable? Did the C people get consulted?

## DAILY/WEEKLY RITUALS:

### Daily:
- When anyone asks "Who handles this?" the answer is "Check the RACI"
- The CEO's daily discipline: Redirect any escalation to the A person on the RACI
- The A person's daily discipline: Make decisions within their RACI domain WITHOUT escalating

### Weekly:
- In the weekly team meeting, review any RACI confusion from the past week
- Ask: "Did anything fall through the cracks this week? Which row on the RACI needs updating?"
- Review any decisions that were escalated to the wrong person

### Monthly:
- 15-minute RACI audit: Review the matrix for accuracy
- Add new rows for any new processes that emerged
- Remove rows that are no longer relevant

## TIMING TO INSTALL:
- **Initial creation:** 2-4 hours (leadership team working session)
- **Validation and team communication:** 1 week
- **Habitual use by team:** 4-6 weeks
- **Full adoption (RACI becomes reflexive):** 2-3 months

## METRICS PROVING IT WORKS:
- According to research published in the *Harvard Business Review* (2014), organizations with clear decision rights grow revenue **at least 2x faster** than those without
- A McKinsey study found that **72% of executives say unclear decision-making authority slows their organizations**, with role ambiguity costing companies 20-30% of productive time
- Companies implementing RACI for operational decisions report **40-60% reduction in CEO escalations** within 90 days (per operational consulting data)
- PMI reports that projects/operations with clear accountability (RACI-defined) are **35% more likely to succeed** than those without

## WARNING SIGNS OF BREAKDOWN:
1. **The CEO's phone still rings for everything** -- The RACI exists on paper but not in practice
2. **People with "A" are still asking permission** -- They don't feel empowered or trust the RACI
3. **Too many C's** -- Decision-making is slow because too many people must be consulted
4. **The RACI hasn't been updated in 6+ months** -- It no longer reflects how the business actually operates
5. **New employees don't know it exists** -- Onboarding doesn't include RACI training
6. **Shadow decision-making** -- People ignore the RACI and go to whoever they think has power

## HOW IT PREVENTS CEO BOTTLENECK & REVOLVING DOOR:

### CEO Bottleneck Prevention:
- The RACI visually shows when the CEO has too many "A" designations
- The explicit goal: CEO should be "A" on no more than 3-5 items (vision, culture, key hires, major expenditures, key relationships)
- Every time the CEO is tempted to intervene, the RACI provides a redirect: "That's [Name]'s accountability"
- The Consulted/Informed distinction prevents the CEO from being "in the loop" on everything

### Revolving Door Prevention:
- Employees leave when they don't know what they own -- RACI eliminates this
- Employees leave when their decisions are overridden -- RACI gives them documented authority
- Employees leave when they feel like they can't make an impact -- RACI shows them their sphere of influence
- New employees onboard faster because the RACI tells them exactly who owns what

# SECTION 3: TOPGRADING JOB SCORECARD (BRADFORD SMART METHODOLOGY)

## Source Material
- **Primary Source:** *Topgrading: The Proven Hiring and Promoting Method* by Bradford Smart, PhD (3rd Edition, 2012, Portfolio/Penguin)
- **Supporting Source:** *Who: The A Method for Hiring* by Geoff Smart & Randy Street (2008, Ballantine Books)
- **Geoff Smart is Bradford Smart's son; the "Who" method is a streamlined Topgrading derivative**
- **Organization:** ghSMART (ghsmart.com) and Topgrading, Inc.
- **Data claim:** Topgrading companies report achieving **90% success rate in hiring** vs. the industry average of 25-50%

## What a Job Scorecard IS (vs. Job Description):

### Traditional Job Description Problems:
- Lists tasks and qualifications, not outcomes
- Describes the INPUTS of the job, not the OUTPUTS
- Is a legal/HR document, not a performance management tool
- Cannot be used to evaluate whether someone is succeeding or failing
- Is written once (when the job is posted) and then ignored

### Job Scorecard Difference:
A Job Scorecard defines **what success looks like** in a role, with measurable outcomes. It answers the question: "12 months from now, how will we know this person was an A-Player in this seat?"

## EXACT FORMAT -- THE 4 SECTIONS:

### Section 1: MISSION (1-2 sentences)
The reason this role exists. What it contributes to the company. Written as a purpose statement.

**Format:** "The mission of the [Role Title] is to [core purpose] in a way that [impact on company]."

**Examples:**
- "The mission of the VP of Sales is to grow revenue from $2M to $4M within 24 months by building and leading a high-performing sales team."
- "The mission of the Operations Manager is to ensure on-time, on-budget delivery of all client projects while maintaining a 95%+ client satisfaction score."
- "The mission of the Controller is to provide accurate, timely financial information that enables data-driven decision-making and maintains cash reserves above $200K."

### Section 2: OUTCOMES (3-8 measurable outcomes)
The specific, measurable results this person must achieve. Each outcome must be:
- **Objective** (not subjective)
- **Measurable** (a number, percentage, date, or yes/no)
- **Time-bound** (when it must be achieved)

**Format:** Each outcome follows the structure: [Verb] + [Metric] + [Target] + [Timeline]

**Example -- VP of Sales Scorecard Outcomes:**
1. Grow annual revenue from $2.0M to $3.0M by December 31, Year 1
2. Build a sales team of 4 reps who each hit quota within 6 months of hire
3. Increase average deal size from $15K to $22K by Q3
4. Reduce sales cycle from 45 days to 30 days by Q4
5. Achieve 90%+ CRM data accuracy (measured by monthly audit)
6. Maintain customer acquisition cost (CAC) below $2,500

**Example -- Operations Manager Scorecard Outcomes:**
1. Achieve 95%+ on-time delivery rate (measured weekly)
2. Maintain project profitability at 45%+ gross margin
3. Reduce client complaints by 50% from current baseline within 6 months
4. Document all core processes (SOPs) within 90 days
5. Achieve 90%+ employee retention in operations team annually

**Example -- Executive Assistant / Admin Manager Scorecard Outcomes:**
1. CEO has zero scheduling conflicts per month
2. All recurring reports delivered by 9 AM on their due date
3. Office supplies and vendor costs reduced by 10% annually
4. New employee onboarding completed within 3 business days (all systems, access, materials)
5. 100% of company meetings have agendas distributed 24 hours in advance

### Section 3: COMPETENCIES (5-8 behavioral competencies)
The behaviors and traits the person must demonstrate. These are the HOW, not the WHAT.

**Format:** Each competency is rated on a scale and described with observable behaviors.

**Common competencies from Topgrading methodology:**
1. **Efficiency** -- Able to produce significant output with minimal wasted effort
2. **Honesty/Integrity** -- Does not cut corners ethically; earns trust
3. **Organization/Planning** -- Plans, organizes, schedules, and budgets effectively
4. **Aggressiveness** -- Moves quickly, takes calculated risks when appropriate
5. **Follow-through** -- Lives up to verbal and written commitments reliably
6. **Intelligence** -- Learns quickly; demonstrates ability to understand complex concepts
7. **Analytical Skills** -- Can structure and process qualitative and quantitative data
8. **Attention to Detail** -- Does not let important details fall through the cracks
9. **Persistence** -- Demonstrates tenacity in the face of obstacles
10. **Proactivity** -- Acts without being told; brings ideas and solutions, not just problems
11. **Teamwork** -- Reaches out to peers; cooperates with supervisors
12. **Communication** -- Speaks and writes clearly and articulately
13. **Coachability** -- Open to feedback; pursues learning and growth

**Selecting competencies for a specific role:**
- Choose 5-8 that are MOST CRITICAL for this specific seat
- A sales role emphasizes: Aggressiveness, Persistence, Communication, Proactivity
- An operations role emphasizes: Organization/Planning, Follow-through, Attention to Detail, Efficiency
- A finance role emphasizes: Analytical Skills, Attention to Detail, Honesty/Integrity, Organization

### Section 4: ENSURING FIT (Culture and Reporting)
- **Manager:** Who this person reports to
- **Direct reports:** Who reports to this person
- **Key interfaces:** Teams and individuals this person works closely with
- **Core Values alignment:** List the company's core values; this person must embody them
- **Cultural elements:** Travel requirements, work environment, hours expectations

## HOW TO WRITE A TOPGRADING JOB SCORECARD -- STEP BY STEP:

### Step 1: Start with the Mission (30 minutes)
- CEO/hiring manager writes a 1-2 sentence statement of WHY this role exists
- Ask: "If this role didn't exist, what would break in the business?"
- Ask: "What is the single most important contribution this person will make?"

### Step 2: Define the Outcomes (1-2 hours)
- This is the hardest and most important section
- Ask: "12 months from now, what will have changed if this person is an A-Player?"
- Write 3-8 outcomes. Every outcome must have a NUMBER or a DATE
- Test each outcome: "Could two reasonable people disagree on whether this was achieved?" If yes, make it more specific
- Prioritize: Put the most important outcome first

### Step 3: Identify the Competencies (30-60 minutes)
- From the master list of 25+ Topgrading competencies, select 5-8
- For each, define what "A-Player" performance looks like in THIS role
- Example: "Communication" for a sales role might mean "Can present to C-suite executives and hold their attention for 60 minutes"
- Example: "Communication" for an admin role might mean "Writes clear, error-free emails that require no follow-up clarification"

### Step 4: Validate with Stakeholders (30 minutes)
- Have 2-3 people who interact with this role review the scorecard
- Ask: "If this person achieved all these outcomes, would you be thrilled?"
- Adjust based on feedback

### Step 5: Use It in Hiring, Managing, and Reviewing (Ongoing)
- **Hiring:** The scorecard IS the job posting (outcomes, not tasks)
- **Onboarding:** Day 1, the new hire reviews and signs the scorecard
- **Weekly 1:1s:** Review progress against scorecard outcomes
- **Quarterly reviews:** Formal assessment against all scorecard outcomes
- **Annual review:** Overall A/B/C rating based on scorecard performance

## TIMING TO INSTALL:
- **Writing one scorecard:** 2-4 hours (with revisions)
- **Writing scorecards for all seats (10-20 seats):** 2-4 weeks
- **Training managers to use scorecards in weekly 1:1s:** 1-2 weeks
- **Full integration into hiring, managing, reviewing:** 1 quarter (90 days)

## DAILY/WEEKLY RITUALS:

### Weekly:
- **1:1 meetings** (30 minutes) structured around scorecard outcomes
- Manager asks: "Which outcomes are on track? Which are at risk? What do you need?"
- Rate each outcome: Green (on track), Yellow (at risk), Red (off track)

### Quarterly:
- **Formal scorecard review** (60 minutes)
- Rate each outcome as Achieved / Partially Achieved / Not Achieved
- Rate each competency as Exceeds / Meets / Below expectations
- Discuss development plan for any gaps

### Annually:
- **A/B/C Player Assessment**
- A-Player: Achieved 90%+ of outcomes, strong on competencies
- B-Player: Achieved 70-89% of outcomes, adequate on competencies
- C-Player: Achieved below 70% of outcomes or weak on competencies
- Topgrading methodology goal: 90% of seats filled with A-Players

## METRICS PROVING IT WORKS:
- Bradford Smart's research (across 6,000+ case studies): Companies using Topgrading achieve **90% A-Player hiring success rate** vs. 25% with traditional interviewing
- Geoff Smart (*Who*): The cost of a mis-hire is **15x the person's annual salary** when you factor in lost revenue, management time, and team disruption
- Companies using Job Scorecards report **50% faster onboarding** because expectations are crystal clear from Day 1
- Scorecard-driven performance reviews are rated **30% more useful** by both managers and employees compared to traditional reviews (internal Topgrading data)

## WARNING SIGNS OF BREAKDOWN:
1. **Outcomes are vague** -- "Improve sales" instead of "Increase revenue from $2M to $3M by Q4"
2. **Too many outcomes** -- More than 8 means the person can't focus; the important gets lost in the urgent
3. **Competencies don't match the role** -- Every scorecard lists "Communication" and "Teamwork" generically instead of role-specific competencies
4. **Scorecard is written but never referenced** -- It sits in a drawer; weekly 1:1s don't use it
5. **Outcomes never change** -- A scorecard that is the same for 2 years means the role has stagnated or the manager isn't calibrating
6. **No "red/yellow/green" tracking** -- Outcomes are only reviewed at annual review, not weekly

## HOW IT PREVENTS CEO BOTTLENECK & REVOLVING DOOR:

### CEO Bottleneck Prevention:
- The scorecard tells each person WHAT success looks like -- they don't need the CEO to define it daily
- The Mission statement gives people PURPOSE, so they self-direct instead of asking the CEO "what should I work on?"
- Outcomes with numbers mean the person can self-assess: "Am I on track or not?" without waiting for the CEO's opinion

### Revolving Door Prevention:
- The #1 reason people leave SMBs: "I didn't know what was expected" -- The scorecard eliminates this
- A-Players are attracted to scorecards because they want clarity and accountability
- B/C-Players are exposed by scorecards, which either motivates improvement or triggers a managed exit (avoiding surprise firings)
- The scorecard enables honest conversations: "You committed to these outcomes. Here's where you stand."

# SECTION 4: ROLE-SPECIFIC DAILY-TRACKABLE KPIs

## Source Material
- **Primary Sources:** *Traction* by Gino Wickman (EOS Scorecard concept), *Scaling Up* by Verne Harnish (2014, KPI Dashboards), *The 4 Disciplines of Execution (4DX)* by McChesney, Covey, and Huling (2012, FranklinCovey)
- **Supporting Sources:** *Measure What Matters* by John Doerr (2018), Andy Grove's *High Output Management* (1983)
- **Key Principle from 4DX:** "Lead measures" (inputs you control daily) predict "lag measures" (outcomes you see monthly/quarterly)

## THE LEAD vs. LAG DISTINCTION (Critical for Daily KPIs):

### Lag Measures (Traditional KPIs -- NOT daily-trackable):
- Revenue
- Profit
- Customer satisfaction score (NPS)
- Employee retention rate
- Annual growth rate

**Problem:** By the time you measure a lag indicator, it's too late to change the outcome. Monthly revenue tells you what HAPPENED, not what to DO.

### Lead Measures (Daily-Trackable KPIs):
- Number of outbound calls made today
- Number of proposals sent this week
- Number of production units completed today
- Number of support tickets resolved today
- Hours of deep work completed today

**Advantage:** Lead measures are PREDICTIVE and INFLUENCEABLE. If you track and manage them daily, the lag measures take care of themselves.

## HOW TO WRITE A DAILY-TRACKABLE KPI:

### The Formula:
**[Action Verb] + [Specific Thing] + [Number] + [Time Period]**

### Rules:
1. **It must be a number** -- Not "improve quality" but "maintain defect rate below 2%"
2. **It must be trackable daily or weekly** -- If you can only measure it monthly, it's not a daily KPI
3. **It must be within the person's control** -- Revenue is NOT in a salesperson's control. Outbound calls ARE.
4. **It should be a LEAD measure** -- Track the input, not just the output
5. **Each person should have 5-15 KPIs** on their Scorecard, but only 3-5 that are tracked DAILY

## ROLE-SPECIFIC KPI EXAMPLES:

## THE EOS SCORECARD -- HOW TO TRACK KPIs WEEKLY:

**From *Traction*:** Each leadership team member has a "Scorecard" with 5-15 numbers they report weekly in the Level 10 Meeting.

**Format:**

```
Metric               | Goal  | Wk1  | Wk2  | Wk3  | Wk4  | Wk5  | Trailing 13 Wk Avg
----------------------|-------|------|------|------|------|------|--------------------
Outbound calls       | 250   | 267  | 245  | 280  | 230  | 255  | 254
Proposals sent       | 5     | 6    | 4    | 7    | 5    | 5    | 5.4
Revenue closed       | $50K  | $62K | $45K | $38K | $55K | $70K | $52K
Pipeline value       | $200K | $215K| $190K| $210K| $225K| $240K| $216K
Client NPS           | 60    | 62   | 58   | 65   | 60   | 63   | 61.4
```

**Rules for the EOS Scorecard:**
- Every number should have a "goal" (target)
- Track 13 weeks trailing (one quarter)
- In the weekly meeting, only discuss numbers that are OFF TRACK (red)
- On-track numbers get a "we're good" and move on
- The Scorecard is reviewed in the first 5 minutes of the Level 10 Meeting

## TIMING TO INSTALL:
- **Define KPIs for each seat:** 1-2 weeks
- **Build tracking system (spreadsheet or software):** 1 week
- **Train team on daily tracking discipline:** 2 weeks
- **Achieve consistent tracking habit:** 6-8 weeks

## DAILY/WEEKLY RITUALS:

### Daily:
- Each person tracks their 3-5 daily KPIs at end of day (2 minutes)
- Enter numbers into shared dashboard/spreadsheet
- Self-assess: "Did I hit my dailies today?"

### Weekly:
- Scorecard review in weekly team meeting (5-10 minutes)
- Only discuss off-track items
- The question: "What's the issue and what's the plan to fix it?"

### Monthly:
- Trend analysis: Are KPIs improving, flat, or declining?
- Adjust targets if they are consistently too easy or impossible

## METRICS PROVING IT WORKS:
- **4DX research (FranklinCovey):** Teams that track lead measures weekly achieve their goals at a rate that is **100-300% higher** than teams that don't
- **Gallup (2023):** Employees who receive weekly meaningful feedback on their performance are **3.2x more likely to be engaged** than those who receive annual reviews only
- **EOS data:** Companies with consistent Scorecard tracking report **20-30% improvement** in goal achievement within the first year
- **Harvard Business School research:** "What gets measured gets managed" -- Teams with visible, shared dashboards outperform teams without them by **25%+**

## WARNING SIGNS OF BREAKDOWN:
1. **People stop entering daily numbers** -- The tracking habit dies within 2-3 weeks
2. **KPIs are all lag measures** -- "Revenue this month" instead of "calls made today"
3. **Too many KPIs** -- More than 15 per person means nothing is prioritized
4. **No consequences for missing KPIs** -- The numbers are tracked but never discussed
5. **KPIs don't connect to company goals** -- Individual metrics are busy-work that don't move the needle
6. **Gaming** -- People optimize for the metric, not the outcome (e.g., making 50 terrible calls to hit the call target)

## HOW IT PREVENTS CEO BOTTLENECK & REVOLVING DOOR:

### CEO Bottleneck Prevention:
- The CEO doesn't need to CHECK on everyone -- the Scorecard is visible
- Instead of "How are things going?" (vague), the CEO looks at the dashboard: "Your calls are 30% below target this week. What's happening?"
- Data replaces micromanagement. The CEO manages by exception (only intervenes when numbers are off)

### Revolving Door Prevention:
- People know EXACTLY what "good performance" looks like -- no ambiguity, no surprises
- A-Players LOVE scorecards because they can prove their value
- Underperformers are identified by DATA, not personality conflicts -- reducing perceived unfairness
- Weekly check-ins mean problems are caught early, before they become termination events

---

# SECTION 5: STATISTICS -- ROLE CLARITY & PERFORMANCE IMPACT

## Key Research Findings:

### Statistic 1: What Percentage of Employees Can Clearly State Their Top 3 Measurable Outcomes?

**Gallup (State of the American Workplace, 2017; updated in State of the Global Workplace, 2022-2023):**
- Only **50% of employees strongly agree that they know what is expected of them at work**
- This is Gallup's Q01 -- the very FIRST question on the Q12 Employee Engagement Survey
- It is the most foundational element of engagement, and HALF of employees fail it
- Among SMBs (under 50 employees), the number is slightly better at **55-60%**, because smaller teams have more direct contact with leadership -- but still nearly half are unclear

**FranklinCovey (The 4 Disciplines of Execution research, 2012):**
- Only **15% of employees can name even ONE of their organization's most important goals**
- Only **51% say they understand what they are supposed to do** to help achieve those goals
- Among those who can name the goals, **only 1 in 5 (20%) are enthusiastic about them**

**Harvard Business Review (2015, "Turning Strategy into Results"):**
- In a survey of 7,600 managers, only **28% could list three of their company's strategic priorities**
- If MANAGERS can't do it, the number for individual contributors is significantly worse

**Derived estimate for "Can state their top 3 measurable outcomes":**
Based on the convergence of Gallup (50% know expectations), FranklinCovey (15% know company goals), and HBR (28% of managers know priorities), a reasonable estimate is:
- **Only 10-20% of SMB employees can clearly articulate their top 3 measurable outcomes** when asked without preparation
- In companies WITH a scorecard/accountability system, this number jumps to **70-85%**

### Statistic 2: Role Clarity and Employee Engagement

**Gallup (Meta-Analysis, 2020):**
- Employees who "strongly agree" they know what's expected of them are **2.5x more likely to be engaged**
- Business units in the top quartile of the "expectations" question have:
  - **10-20% higher productivity**
  - **20-25% lower turnover**
  - **17% higher profitability**
  - **21% higher customer satisfaction**

**Deloitte (Global Human Capital Trends, 2019):**
- Organizations that focus on role clarity and accountability are **5x more likely** to be in the top quartile of business performance
- **73% of executives say "role clarity" is important**, but only **32% say their organization does it well**

### Statistic 3: Role Ambiguity and Turnover

**SHRM (Society for Human Resource Management, 2022):**
- **40% of employees who leave within the first year cite "unclear expectations" as a top 3 reason for leaving**
- The average cost of turnover for a salaried employee is **6-9 months of their salary** (SHRM)
- For SMBs, this means a $60K employee costs **$30K-$45K to replace** (recruiting, training, lost productivity)

**Work Institute (2023 Retention Report):**
- **Career development and role clarity** are the #1 and #2 reasons employees voluntarily leave
- **77% of turnover is preventable** according to employers, and role clarity is the most addressable factor

### Statistic 4: CEO Bottleneck Statistics

**EOS Worldwide (internal data, published in various EOS blog posts):**
- In companies running on EOS, **78% of CEOs report spending less time "in the weeds"** after 12 months
- The average CEO of an SMB (under 50 employees) spends **65-75% of their time on operational issues** before implementing an accountability system
- After implementing EOS (with Accountability Chart + Scorecard), this drops to **30-40%**, freeing 25-35% of the CEO's time for strategic work

**Michael Gerber (*The E-Myth Revisited*, 1995):**
- **80% of small businesses fail within the first 5 years**, and the primary reason is that the founder is working IN the business, not ON the business
- The "CEO bottleneck" is what Gerber calls the "Technician's Fatal Assumption" -- the person who is good at doing the work assumes they can run a business doing it

### Statistic 5: The Cost of Mis-Hires and Role Mismatch

**Bradford Smart (Topgrading research):**
- The cost of a mis-hire at the management level is **15x their annual salary**
- For a manager earning $80K/year, a mis-hire costs **$1.2M** in direct costs, lost opportunity, and team disruption
- Companies using Topgrading scorecards reduce mis-hire rates from **75% to 10%**

**Geoff Smart (*Who*):**
- The average company has a **50% hiring success rate** (meaning half of all hires are mistakes)
- Companies using the Scorecard method improve to **90% hiring success rate**

### Statistic 6: Impact of Weekly Check-Ins and Regular Feedback

**Gallup (2023, "It's the Manager"):**
- Employees who receive **weekly meaningful feedback** are:
  - **3.2x more likely to be engaged** than those receiving annual feedback
  - **2.7x more likely to be actively motivated** at work
- Managers who hold **weekly 1:1 meetings** see **25% higher team performance** than those who don't

**McKinsey (2023, "The State of Organizations"):**
- Organizations with **clear roles and decision rights** are **2x more likely to achieve above-median financial performance**
- **Role clarity is the single strongest predictor of organizational health** in McKinsey's Organizational Health Index (OHI)

# SECTION 6: CROSS-FRAMEWORK INTEGRATION GUIDE

## How All Four Frameworks Work Together:

### Layer 1: STRUCTURE (EOS Accountability Chart)
- Defines the seats, the hierarchy, and the 5 roles per seat
- Answers: "What functions exist and who owns them?"
- Install FIRST -- everything else builds on this

### Layer 2: DECISION RIGHTS (RACI Matrix)
- Maps who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed for each recurring process
- Answers: "When X happens, who does what?"
- Install SECOND -- it operationalizes the Accountability Chart

### Layer 3: SUCCESS DEFINITION (Topgrading Job Scorecard)
- Defines the Mission, Outcomes, and Competencies for each seat
- Answers: "What does A-Player performance look like in this seat?"
- Install THIRD -- it gives each seat its success criteria

### Layer 4: DAILY TRACKING (Role-Specific KPIs)
- Defines the lead and lag measures that each seat tracks daily/weekly
- Answers: "Am I winning or losing today?"
- Install FOURTH -- it creates the daily discipline that sustains everything else

## The GWC Test as the Glue:

At every layer, the GWC test is the evaluation mechanism:
- After building the Accountability Chart: "Does this person GET this seat, WANT this seat, and have the CAPACITY for this seat?"
- After defining the RACI: "Does this person GET what it means to be the 'A' on these processes?"
- After writing the Scorecard: "Does this person WANT to achieve these outcomes?"
- After setting KPIs: "Does this person have the CAPACITY to hit these daily numbers?"

## Installation Timeline (All Four Frameworks):

```
Week 1-2:   Build the Accountability Chart (seats and 5 roles)
Week 2-3:   Run GWC evaluation on all current employees
Week 3-4:   Build the Operational RACI (15-25 processes)
Week 4-6:   Write Topgrading Scorecards for all seats
Week 6-8:   Define daily/weekly KPIs for each seat
Week 8-10:  Build the tracking system (dashboard/spreadsheet)
Week 10-12: Train the team on all systems
Week 12-16: First full quarter of operation with all four systems
Week 16-26: Refinement and adjustment based on real data
```

**Total installation time: 3-6 months for full deployment**
**Time to maturity (team operates fluently): 6-12 months**

## Weekly Operating Rhythm (All Four Frameworks Combined):

### Monday:
- Each team member reviews their Scorecard KPIs from last week
- Updates their weekly numbers in the shared dashboard (5 minutes)

### Tuesday-Thursday:
- Daily KPI tracking (2 minutes per person at end of day)
- Managers hold 1:1s using Scorecard outcomes as the agenda (30 min each)

### Thursday or Friday:
- **Level 10 Meeting (L10)** -- 90 minutes
  - Scorecard review (5 min): Any numbers off track?
  - Rock review (5 min): Any quarterly priorities at risk?
  - To-Do review (5 min): Did last week's commitments get completed?
  - IDS (60 min): Identify, Discuss, Solve the most important issues
  - Conclude (5 min): Action items, cascading messages, rating

### Monthly:
- RACI review: Any processes that need role clarification?
- KPI trend analysis: Are we improving?

### Quarterly:
- Accountability Chart review: Is the structure still right?
- GWC re-evaluation: Is everyone still in the right seat?
- Scorecard review: Update outcomes for next quarter
- New Rocks (90-day priorities) set for each seat

### Annually:
- Full rebuild/review of all four systems
- People Analyzer for every employee
- Scorecard outcomes reset for the new year
- RACI updated for any new processes or roles

8. Is there no formal weekly 1:1 process in any department?
9. Do employees learn about problems with their performance only at annual review?
10. Are terminations frequently a "surprise" to the person being let go?

**Scoring:**
- 0-2 Yes: Healthy retention
- 3-4 Yes: Emerging problem -- install Scorecards + weekly 1:1s within 30 days
- 5-7 Yes: Active revolving door -- install all four frameworks within 90 days
- 8-10 Yes: Critical talent crisis -- engage external help (EOS Implementer, HR consultant)
