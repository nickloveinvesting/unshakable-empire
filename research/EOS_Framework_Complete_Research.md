## 1. LEVEL 10 MEETING AGENDA

**Total Duration:** 90 minutes, no exceptions
**Frequency:** Weekly, same day, same time, every week
**Participants:** Leadership team (typically 3-8 people)
**Rules:** Starts on time. Ends on time. Same agenda every week. No devices unless referencing data.

### Exact Agenda Breakdown:

| # | Section | Time | Running Total |
|---|---------|------|---------------|
| 1 | Segue (Good News) | 5 minutes | 0:05 |
| 2 | Scorecard Review | 5 minutes | 0:10 |
| 3 | Rock Review | 5 minutes | 0:15 |
| 4 | Customer/Employee Headlines | 5 minutes | 0:20 |
| 5 | To-Do List Review | 5 minutes | 0:25 |
| 6 | IDS (Identify, Discuss, Solve) | 60 minutes | 1:25 |
| 7 | Conclude | 5 minutes | 1:30 |

### Section-by-Section Detail:

**SECTION 1 -- SEGUE (5 minutes)**
- Each person shares one personal best and one professional best from the past week
- Purpose: Human connection, positive energy, vulnerability
- NOT a status update -- this is personal
- Goes around the table, each person gets ~30-45 seconds

**SECTION 2 -- SCORECARD REVIEW (5 minutes)**
- Review the 5-15 numbers on the company Scorecard
- Each number owner reports whether their metric is on track or off track
- Off-track numbers get moved to the Issues List -- NOT discussed here
- Report ONLY: "hit" or "missed" -- no explanations, no excuses
- The discipline is speed: a quick pulse check, not a deep dive

**SECTION 3 -- ROCK REVIEW (5 minutes)**
- Each person reports each of their Rocks as "On Track" or "Off Track"
- No lengthy explanations
- Off-track Rocks move to the Issues List
- Simple binary status: thumbs up or thumbs down
- Goal: 80%+ of Rocks should be on track at any given time

**SECTION 4 -- CUSTOMER/EMPLOYEE HEADLINES (5 minutes)**
- Brief updates on notable customer or employee news
- Good news or bad news -- both reported
- Any item needing discussion goes to the Issues List
- Format: one sentence per headline, no debate
- Examples: "Lost Client X" or "Hired new ops manager" or "Client Y renewed for 3 years"

**SECTION 5 -- TO-DO LIST REVIEW (5 minutes)**
- Review all 7-day action items from the previous week
- Each person reports each to-do as "Done" or "Not Done"
- Target: 90% completion rate every single week
- Not-done items either drop off (no longer relevant) or carry forward
- If consistently below 90%, that itself becomes an Issue

**SECTION 6 -- IDS: IDENTIFY, DISCUSS, SOLVE (60 minutes)**
- This is the heart of the meeting -- 2/3 of total meeting time
- Team identifies the top 3 most important issues from the Issues List
- Issues are attacked one at a time using the IDS process (see Section 4 below)
- Solved issues produce To-Dos with owners and 7-day deadlines
- Unsolved issues stay on the list for next week
- Average team solves 3-7 issues per meeting

**SECTION 7 -- CONCLUDE (5 minutes)**
- Recap all new To-Dos created during IDS
- Confirm who owns each To-Do
- Identify any cascading messages (what needs to be communicated to teams)
- Rate the meeting 1-10 (target: consistent 8+ ratings)
- Each person states their rating out loud

### L10 Meeting Rules:
1. Same Day, Same Time -- never moves
2. Same Agenda -- never changes
3. Starts on time -- even if people are missing
4. Ends on time -- no exceptions
5. No devices unless referencing meeting data
6. No tangents -- tangents go to the Issues List

## 2. THE SCORECARD STRUCTURE

### Definition
A weekly reporting tool containing 5-15 key measurable numbers that give you the "pulse" of your business at a glance.

### Column Structure (Left to Right):

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Who** | Single accountable owner (one person per number) |
| **Measurable** | The specific metric being tracked |
| **Goal** | The weekly target/threshold for that metric |
| **Week 1** | Actual number for Week 1 of the quarter |
| **Week 2** | Actual number for Week 2 |
| **...** | Continues across... |
| **Week 13** | Actual number for Week 13 (final week of quarter) |

### Key Structural Rules:

- **5-15 numbers total** -- enough to cover the essential parts of the business, small enough to review in 5 minutes
- **13 trailing weeks displayed** -- one column per week, covering the full quarter
- **One owner per number** -- if two people own something, nobody owns it
- **Weekly targets, not monthly** -- every number has a weekly goal
- **Activity-based (leading) indicators preferred** over lagging indicators
- **Green/Red visual indicators** -- hit = on track; missed = off track

### Types of Metrics to Include:

**Revenue/Financial:**
- Weekly revenue
- Cash balance
- Accounts receivable over 60 days
- Gross margin percentage

**Sales/Marketing:**
- New leads generated per week
- Proposals sent
- Close rate
- Customer acquisition cost

**Operations:**
- On-time delivery rate
- Error/defect rate
- Capacity utilization
- Client satisfaction score (NPS or equivalent)

**People:**
- Open positions
- Employee satisfaction pulse
- Training completion rate

### Review Cadence:
- **Entered:** Weekly, before the L10 meeting
- **Reviewed:** Every L10 meeting during the 5-minute Scorecard section
- **Trailing view:** 4-week or 13-week intervals to spot trends
- **Off-track numbers** are NOT discussed during Scorecard review -- they drop to the Issues List

### The "<15-Number Rule":
The Scorecard must not exceed 15 numbers. If you cannot tell the health of your business from fewer than 15 numbers, you are tracking the wrong things.

---

## 3. THE ROCKS SYSTEM (90-Day Priorities)

### Definition
Rocks are the 3-7 most important things that MUST get done in the next 90 days to move the company toward its vision. Named after Stephen Covey's "big rocks" analogy.

### Structure:

**Company Rocks:** 3-7 priorities for the entire organization
**Individual Rocks:** 3-7 per person on the leadership team (each person)
**Departmental Rocks:** Cascade down -- department heads set Rocks for their teams

### SMART Rock Requirements (Each Rock Must Have):
1. **Specific outcome** -- not vague, clearly defined deliverable
2. **Measurable success criteria** -- binary: done or not done
3. **Single owner** -- one accountable person
4. **Realistic timeline** -- achievable within the 90-day window
5. **Clear connection to company goals** -- ties to V/TO vision

### Rock Tracking Format:

| Rock Description | Owner | Status | Due Date |
|-----------------|-------|--------|----------|
| "Launch new CRM by March 31" | John | On Track | Q1 End |
| "Hire 3 sales reps" | Sarah | Off Track | Q1 End |

### Weekly Tracking (During L10 Meetings):
- Each person reports each Rock as **"On Track"** or **"Off Track"**
- No explanations needed if on track
- Off-track Rocks automatically become Issues for IDS
- The status is binary -- no "kind of on track"

### Milestones:
- Each Rock should be broken into weekly milestones
- Milestones are the smaller, sequential goals that create a definitive path to completion
- If milestones are not being hit progressively, the Rock is OFF TRACK
- Example: Rock = "Launch new website by March 31"
  - Week 1-2: Complete wireframes
  - Week 3-4: Design mockups approved
  - Week 5-8: Development complete
  - Week 9-10: Testing and QA
  - Week 11-12: Content migration
  - Week 13: Launch

### Completion Targets:
- **80%+ Rock completion rate** across the team = healthy traction
- Below 80% = capacity issues or priority problems
- 100% is not the goal -- 80% keeps the bar realistic but high

### Setting Cadence:
- Rocks are SET during the quarterly meeting (full-day session)
- Process: Individual brainstorm (10 min) -> sharing (20 min) -> organizational Rock selection (30 min) -> individual assignment (20 min) -> documentation (10 min)
- Every Rock must be approved/agreed upon by the full leadership team

---

## 4. THE ISSUES SOLVING TRACK (IDS: IDENTIFY, DISCUSS, SOLVE)

### The Three-Step Process:

#### STEP 1: IDENTIFY (The Root Cause)
- State the issue in one clear sentence
- If you cannot state it in one sentence, you have not identified it yet
- Ask "Why?" multiple times until you reach the ROOT cause
- The first problem you see is RARELY the real one
- Example: "Sales are down" is NOT the issue. "Our close rate dropped from 40% to 25% because we changed the proposal format" IS the issue
- ONE person states the issue. Everyone else listens.

#### STEP 2: DISCUSS (Open Dialogue)
- Everyone contributes relevant facts, data, and experience
- Rules of discussion:
  - Leave egos at the door
  - Focus on the greater good of the company
  - No tangents (tangents become new Issues on the list)
  - Everyone's voice must be heard
  - Stay on the single issue being discussed
- The discussion should be honest and direct
- Use the "animal signals" for communication discipline:
  - **Elephant in the Room** -- signal that a major issue is being avoided
  - **Sacred Cow** -- challenge protected assumptions that need questioning
  - **Squirrel** -- redirect when someone goes off-topic/tangent
  - **Dead Horse** -- indicate when a topic has been discussed enough

#### STEP 3: SOLVE (Decide and Assign)
- Brainstorm possible solutions
- Evaluate options objectively
- Choose the BEST solution for the greater good of the company
- Create specific To-Do items with:
  - Assigned single owner
  - 7-day deadline (next L10 meeting)
  - Clear definition of "done"
- Mark the issue as SOLVED and remove from list
- If not fully solved, mark as "Not Solved" and revisit later
- A discussion without a resolution is just talk

### IDS Priority System:
1. Before starting IDS, the team reviews the full Issues List
2. Team votes on the TOP 3 most important issues
3. Issues are attacked in priority order, one at a time
4. Average resolution time: 10-20 minutes per issue
5. Teams typically solve 3-7 issues per 60-minute IDS block

### Three Types of Issues Lists:

| List Type | Where Stored | Reviewed When | Contains |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **Long-Term Issues** | V/TO (Vision/Traction Organizer) | Quarterly and Annual meetings | Strategic, big-picture items for future quarters |
| **Short-Term Issues** | L10 Meeting Issues List | Weekly L10 meetings | Off-track Rocks, bad Scorecard numbers, client problems, people issues |
| **Departmental Issues** | Department meeting list | Weekly department meetings | Tactical, team-level operational issues |

---

## 5. THE ACCOUNTABILITY CHART

### How It Differs from a Traditional Org Chart:

| Feature | Traditional Org Chart | EOS Accountability Chart |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Focus | Reporting relationships | Functions and accountabilities |
| Structure | Based on titles/positions | Based on seats with defined roles |
| Clarity | Shows who reports to whom | Shows who is accountable for what |
| Content | Names and titles only | 3-5 specific roles per seat |
| Flexibility | Rigid, hierarchical | Function-first, adaptable |
| Ownership | Shared responsibility common | ONE person per accountability, always |

### The Default Structure (Top Level):

```
                    VISIONARY
                        |
                    INTEGRATOR
                        |
        --------------------------------
        |           |           |
    Sales/      Operations    Finance/
    Marketing                 Administration
```

### The Two Leadership Seats:

**VISIONARY:**
- Big-picture thinker, idea generator
- Often the founder/entrepreneur
- Responsible for: creative vision, key relationships, culture, big deals, R&D
- Typically has 3-5 defined roles

**INTEGRATOR:**
- Day-to-day operational leader
- Runs the business, manages the leadership team
- Responsible for: harmonizing leadership team, executing the business plan, P&L accountability, removing barriers
- Typically holds the leadership team accountable

### The Three Core Functions (Every Business Has These):

1. **Sales & Marketing** -- generating leads and converting them to customers
2. **Operations** -- delivering the product or service
3. **Finance & Administration** -- managing money, HR, IT, admin

### Seat Definition Rules:
- Each seat has **3-5 roles/bullet points** describing what that seat owns
- Roles represent 80% of the work for that seat
- Each role is a specific accountability, not a task
- One person per seat (a person CAN sit in multiple seats, but each seat has only ONE person)
- If two people own something, NO ONE owns it

### The GWC Evaluation (For Each Person in Each Seat):
- **G -- Get It:** Does the person truly understand the role?
- **W -- Want It:** Does the person genuinely want to do this work?
- **C -- Capacity:** Does the person have the intellectual, physical, emotional, and time capacity?
- All three must be YES for a person to be in the right seat

### The People Analyzer (Core Values Evaluation):

| Core Value | Rating |
|-----------|--------|
| Value 1 | + / +/- / - |
| Value 2 | + / +/- / - |
| Value 3 | + / +/- / - |
| Value 4 | + / +/- / - |
| Value 5 | + / +/- / - |

**Rating Scale:**
- **+** = Consistently demonstrates this value (most of the time)
- **+/-** = Demonstrates this value about half the time
- **-** = Rarely demonstrates this value

**The Bar:** For a company with 5 Core Values, the minimum acceptable bar is typically three "+" ratings and two "+/-" ratings, with ZERO "-" ratings. A single "-" on any Core Value is a serious problem.

### Right Person, Right Seat:
- **Right Person** = Meets or exceeds The Bar on the People Analyzer (Core Values alignment)
- **Right Seat** = Passes GWC for the seat they occupy
- Both must be true. Right person in wrong seat = move them. Wrong person in right seat = exit them.

## 7. WHAT MONDAY LOOKS LIKE FOR AN EOS-IMPLEMENTED COMPANY

### Typical Monday Operating Rhythm:

**Early Morning (8:00-8:15 AM) -- Daily Huddles Cascade**
- Departmental teams stand up for 5-15 minute huddles
- Each person shares: top priorities for the day, where they are stuck
- Managers participate in their team's huddle

**Mid-Morning (9:00-9:15 AM) -- Leadership Huddle**
- Managers and leaders hold their peer huddle
- Same format: priorities, stuck points, quick information exchange
- No problem-solving -- issues go to the list

**Late Morning / Early Afternoon -- The Level 10 Meeting (90 minutes)**
- Most EOS companies schedule their weekly L10 on Monday mornings
- The full 90-minute agenda runs (Segue through Conclude)
- This is the MAIN operational heartbeat of the week
- All Scorecard numbers must be entered BEFORE this meeting
- All Rock statuses must be current BEFORE this meeting

**Monday Afternoon -- Execution Begins**
- New To-Dos from the L10 are immediately in play
- Team members begin working their 7-day action items
- Cascading messages from L10 are communicated to departments
- The week's priorities are crystal clear

### What Gets Reviewed on Monday:
1. Last week's Scorecard numbers (entered before L10)
2. Rock status (on track / off track for each)
3. To-Do completion from last week (target: 90%+ done)
4. New issues surfaced and prioritized
5. New To-Dos assigned with 7-day deadlines

### Pre-Monday Preparation (Sunday Evening or Monday Before L10):
- Each leader enters their Scorecard numbers
- Each leader updates their Rock status
- Each leader reviews their To-Do list for completion
- Issues are added to the Issues List throughout the week (not just Monday)

---

## 8. WHAT FRIDAY LOOKS LIKE FOR AN EOS-IMPLEMENTED COMPANY

### Typical Friday Operating Rhythm:

**Morning -- Daily Huddle (5-15 minutes)**
- Same format as every other day
- Focus: What must get done TODAY to close out the week strong?

**Throughout the Day -- To-Do Completion Push**
- The 90% To-Do completion target creates natural Friday urgency
- Team members are finishing their 7-day action items before Monday's L10
- The mantra: "Will I be able to report 'Done' on Monday?"

**End of Day -- Scorecard Number Entry**
- Leaders finalize and enter their weekly Scorecard numbers
- Numbers must reflect the full week's performance
- Off-track metrics are noted (they will surface in Monday's L10)

**Friday Afternoon -- Individual Preparation for Monday**
- Update Rock status (On Track or Off Track) for each Rock
- Review Issues List -- add any new issues discovered during the week
- Prepare personal/professional "bests" for Monday's Segue

### The Friday Mindset in EOS:
- There is no formal "Friday review meeting" in the standard EOS framework
- Friday is about COMPLETING -- hitting the 90% To-Do bar
- Friday is about PREPARING -- getting data ready for Monday's L10
- The accountability loop closes on Friday and reopens on Monday
- The rhythm is: Monday = report and plan -> Tuesday-Thursday = execute -> Friday = complete and prepare

### Key Friday Metrics to Close:
- To-Dos: Are mine done? (Target: 90%+)
- Scorecard: Are my numbers entered and accurate?
- Rocks: Am I on track with my milestones this week?
- Issues: What needs to go on the list for Monday?

---

## 9. THE VISION/TRACTION ORGANIZER (V/TO) -- THE 8 QUESTIONS

### Format
A two-page strategic document. Page 1 = Vision (Questions 1-5). Page 2 = Traction (Questions 6-8).

---

### PAGE 1: THE VISION SIDE

**QUESTION 1: What Are Your Core Values?**
- Define 3-7 guiding principles that are vital and timeless
- These are NON-NEGOTIABLE behavioral standards
- Used for hiring, firing, reviewing, and rewarding
- They define your culture and the type of people you attract
- Examples: "Do the right thing," "Humbly confident," "Growth-oriented"
- Test: Would you fire your best performer if they violated a Core Value? If yes, it is a real Core Value.

**QUESTION 2: What Is Your Core Focus?**
- Two parts:
  - **Purpose/Cause/Passion** -- WHY you exist (beyond making money)
  - **Niche** -- WHAT you do better than anyone else
- The Core Focus keeps the organization laser-focused
- Everything you do must align with your Core Focus
- If an opportunity does not fit your Core Focus, say no

**QUESTION 3: What Is Your 10-Year Target?**
- ONE big, bold, measurable goal
- Think BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal)
- Should stretch thinking and unite the team
- Must be specific enough to know when you have hit it
- Example: "$50M in revenue" or "10,000 customers served" or "Become the #1 provider in [industry]"

**QUESTION 4: What Is Your Marketing Strategy?**
- Four sub-components:
  - **Target Market** -- Your ideal customer (demographics, psychographics, geography)
  - **Three Uniques** -- Three things that make you different from EVERY competitor (the combination must be unique)
  - **Proven Process** -- Your proprietary methodology/way of doing business, named and visualized
  - **Guarantee** -- Your bold promise to the market (not necessarily a money-back guarantee)

**QUESTION 5: What Is Your 3-Year Picture?**
- A vivid snapshot of the company in 3 years
- Includes:
  - Revenue target
  - Profit target
  - Number of employees
  - What does the company "look like"?
  - What resource/asset milestones exist?
  - Key measurables
- Must be specific enough that everyone can "see" it

---

### PAGE 2: THE TRACTION SIDE

**QUESTION 6: What Is Your 1-Year Plan?**
- Set 3-7 major company goals for the year
- Must include:
  - Revenue goal
  - Profit goal
  - Key measurables/leading indicators
- Each goal must be specific and measurable
- This is the bridge between 3-Year Picture and quarterly Rocks
- Ask: "What must we accomplish THIS YEAR to be on track for our 3-Year Picture?"

**QUESTION 7: What Are Your Quarterly Rocks?**
- 3-7 most important priorities for THIS quarter (90 days)
- Company Rocks (organizational) + Individual Rocks (per person)
- Each Rock has a single owner and a clear completion definition
- These keep the company in "the 90-Day World" -- human focus span
- Rocks are the 90-day milestones toward the 1-Year Plan

**QUESTION 8: What Are Your Issues?**
- A comprehensive list of ALL obstacles, problems, opportunities, and ideas
- This is the company's "Issues List" stored on the V/TO
- Long-term issues live here (discussed at quarterly and annual meetings)
- Short-term issues live on the L10 meeting Issues List
- Nothing is too small or too big -- if it is an issue, it goes on the list
- Issues are solved using IDS (Identify, Discuss, Solve)

---

### V/TO Usage Rules:
- Completed by the leadership team TOGETHER (not by one person alone)
- Shared with the ENTIRE organization -- everyone sees the same vision
- Reviewed and updated QUARTERLY at minimum
- Full refresh happens at the annual 2-day planning session
- The V/TO is the single source of truth for "where we are going and how we will get there"

---

## 10. COMMON IMPLEMENTATION FAILURES AND TIMELINE TO RESULTS

### The 12 Most Common Implementation Failures:

**1. Building the Accountability Chart Around People, Not Structure**
- Designing roles to fit existing people instead of defining what the business needs
- Fix: Build the chart structure-first, THEN place people in seats

**2. Failing to Implement Unique Ability Properly**
- Glossing over the concept of leaders rising to their unique abilities and delegating the rest
- Fix: Ensure each leader is working primarily in their zone of genius

**3. Thinking Foundational Tools Are Enough**
- Reading "Traction," implementing the basics, and stopping there
- Fix: Commit to the full EOS toolbox, not just the surface-level tools

**4. Deprioritizing L10 Meetings**
- Canceling, shortening, or diluting weekly L10 meetings
- Fix: L10 is sacred. Never cancel. Never shorten. Never change the agenda.

**5. Not Applying the 5 Leadership Abilities**
- The 5 abilities: Simplify, Delegate, Predict, Systemize, Structure
- Fix: Study and deliberately practice each ability quarterly

**6. Creating Weak Scorecards**
- Tracking lagging indicators instead of leading indicators
- Missing proactive metrics that predict performance
- Fix: Focus on activity-based, leading metrics that you can influence weekly

**7. Neglecting Team Health and Trust-Building**
- Skipping the vulnerability and trust work required for honest IDS
- Fix: Invest in team health exercises, especially during quarterly and annual sessions

**8. Failing to Master IDS**
- Teams discuss endlessly without solving, or solve without identifying the root cause
- Fix: Practice the discipline of one clear sentence for "Identify," stay on topic during "Discuss," and always end with a To-Do for "Solve"

**9. Lack of Full Leadership Team Commitment**
- Even ONE uncommitted leader poisons the system
- Fix: Require 100% buy-in before starting. If you cannot get it, do not start.

**10. Trying to Implement Everything at Once**
- Rushing to deploy all tools simultaneously
- Fix: Follow the phased implementation roadmap. Master basics before advancing.

**11. Skipping the Accountability Chart Conversation**
- Avoiding the hard conversations about who belongs in which seat
- Fix: Complete the Accountability Chart FIRST -- it is the foundation

**12. Not Revisiting the Accountability Chart During Leadership Changes**
- Plugging new people into old seats without re-evaluating the structure
- Fix: Every time a leadership seat changes, step back and redesign the chart

---

### Implementation Timeline:

| Phase | Timeframe | Focus |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| **Phase 1: Foundation** | Months 1-3 | Rocks, L10 Meetings, Scorecard basics |
| **Phase 2: Vision & People** | Months 3-6 | V/TO completion, Accountability Chart, Core Values, People Analyzer |
| **Phase 3: Data & Process** | Months 6-12 | Scorecard refinement, Core Process documentation, IDS mastery |
| **Phase 4: Full Traction** | Months 12-18 | Full system operating, cascaded to all departments, meeting pulse running at all levels |
| **Phase 5: Mastery** | Months 18-24+ | Continuous improvement, leadership development, organizational health |

### Expected Results Timeline:

- **First 90 days:** Improved meeting discipline, clearer priorities, initial Rock completions
- **6 months:** Noticeable improvement in team alignment, accountability, and issue resolution speed
- **12 months:** Measurable business results (revenue, profit, efficiency), stronger team
- **18 months:** Full system adoption, cascaded through all departments
- **24 months:** System is self-sustaining, culture has shifted, consistent execution

### The 6 Key Components (The Complete EOS Model):

1. **Vision** -- Getting everyone on the same page about where you are going and how you will get there (V/TO)
2. **People** -- Getting the right people in the right seats (Accountability Chart, People Analyzer, GWC)
3. **Data** -- Running the business on facts and figures, not feelings (Scorecard, Measurables)
4. **Issues** -- Strengthening the ability to solve problems permanently (IDS, Issues Lists)
5. **Process** -- Systemizing the business to create consistency and scalability (Core Process documentation, FBA)
6. **Traction** -- Bringing discipline and accountability to execution (Rocks, Meeting Pulse, To-Dos)

### The Process Component Detail:

- Identify 8-14 Core Processes that drive 80% of results (the 20/80 rule)
- Document each using the 3-Step Process Documenter
- Use the FBA (Followed By All) Checklist with four components:
  1. **Train** -- Ensure everyone is trained on the process
  2. **Measure** -- Track adherence and results
  3. **Manage** -- Hold people accountable to following the process
  4. **Update** -- Continuously improve the process

## SUMMARY: THE EOS OPERATING RHYTHM AT A GLANCE

```
ANNUAL (2 days)
  Set: 3-Year Picture, 1-Year Plan, Annual Goals, Budget, Org Structure
    |
QUARTERLY (1 day, every 90 days)
  Set: Quarterly Rocks (3-7 per person), Review V/TO, IDS on strategic issues
    |
WEEKLY (90 minutes, same day/time)
  Review: Scorecard, Rocks, To-Dos, Headlines
  Solve: Top 3 Issues via IDS
  Output: New To-Dos with 7-day deadlines
    |
DAILY (5-15 minutes, standing)
  Share: Top priorities, stuck points
  No problem-solving -- issues go to the list
```

### The Core Loop:
1. Set Rocks quarterly (3-7 per person, 90-day goals)
2. Track progress weekly (Scorecard + Rock status in L10)
3. Solve issues weekly (IDS during L10, 60 minutes)
4. Complete To-Dos weekly (7-day action items, 90% completion rate)
5. Report daily (5-15 minute huddle, priorities and stuck points)
6. Repeat forever
