# 1. CUSTOMER SUCCESS METHODOLOGY

## 1.1 The Desired Outcome Framework (Lincoln Murphy)

**Source: [Lincoln Murphy / Sixteen Ventures](https://sixteenventures.com/customer-success-definition)**

**Core Definition:**
> "Customer Success is when your customer achieves their Desired Outcome through their interactions with your company."

**Desired Outcome = Required Outcome + Appropriate Experience**

| Component | Definition | Example (Consulting Client) |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Required Outcome (RO)** | The job the customer needs to get done; the outcome they absolutely must achieve | "Increase revenue by 20% through improved sales process" |
| **Appropriate Experience (AX)** | HOW the customer needs/wants to achieve it; varies by segment | Enterprise: white-glove, dedicated team, executive access. SMB: self-serve resources + monthly check-ins |

### How to Define Desired Outcome for Each Client

**Step 1: Discovery Questions (During Sales / Onboarding)**
- "What does success look like for you in 6 months?"
- "If we nail this engagement, what changes in your business?"
- "What is the #1 outcome you must achieve?"
- "How would you like to work with us? (frequency, format, access level)"
- "Who else needs to see results from this?"

**Step 2: Document the Desired Outcome**

```
CLIENT DESIRED OUTCOME DOCUMENT
================================
Client: [Name]
Date: [Date]
CSM/Account Owner: [Name]

REQUIRED OUTCOME:
- Primary Goal: [Specific, measurable outcome]
- Secondary Goal(s): [Additional outcomes]
- Timeline: [When they need this achieved]
- Success Metrics: [How we both measure success]

APPROPRIATE EXPERIENCE:
- Communication Preference: [Email/Slack/Phone/In-person]
- Meeting Cadence: [Weekly/Bi-weekly/Monthly]
- Reporting Format: [Dashboard/PDF/Verbal]
- Escalation Path: [Who to contact for what]
- Decision Makers: [Names and roles]
- Stakeholder Map: [Who influences, who decides, who uses]

MILESTONES:
- 30-Day: [First value milestone]
- 60-Day: [Progress milestone]
- 90-Day: [Major outcome milestone]
- 6-Month: [Full value realization]
```

**Step 3: Track the Ever-Evolving Desired Outcome**
- Revisit at every QBR (quarterly)
- Update when client's business changes (new leadership, M&A, market shift)
- Recognize when the client outgrows your services (proactive expansion conversation)

## 1.2 The 8 Elements of Customer Success Management (Lincoln Murphy)

**Source: [Sixteen Ventures - 8 Elements](https://sixteenventures.com/elements-customer-success-management)**

### Element 1: SEGMENTATION
- Do NOT segment by revenue (ARR, ACV, LTV)
- Segment by Appropriate Experience (AX) -- how each segment needs to be served
- Each segment gets different coverage levels (human vs. tech, frequency, depth)

**Service Business Segmentation Example:**

| Segment | Annual Revenue | Coverage Model | CSM Ratio |
|---------|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| Strategic | $250K+ | High-touch: Dedicated CSM, executive sponsor, weekly calls | 1:5-10 |
| Growth | $50K-$250K | Mid-touch: Shared CSM, bi-weekly calls, monthly reporting | 1:15-25 |
| Foundation | $10K-$50K | Low-touch: Pooled CSM, monthly email, quarterly calls | 1:50-100 |

### Element 2: ORCHESTRATION
- Set expectations at 30/60/90 days during onboarding
- Establish joint accountabilities (what YOU will do vs. what THEY must do)
- Signal future expansion opportunities early ("Once we achieve X, we can explore Y")

### Element 3: INTERVENTION
- Proactively move customers toward success milestones
- Trigger types: Time-based, Data-based, Event-based
- If a customer is not taking required actions, escalate the intervention method:
  - Email reminder --> Phone call --> Executive outreach --> In-person visit

### Element 4: MEASUREMENT
- Track TWO types of metrics:
  - **Financial:** Net Revenue Retention (NRR)
  - **CS-Specific:** Success Vector (are customers progressing toward their Desired Outcome?)

### Element 5: EXPANSION (and Renewal)
- Expansion and renewal are natural outcomes of success, not sales activities
- These should be governed by CS, not sales, to maintain alignment with customer goals

### Element 6: COMMUNICATION
- Guide users toward next steps
- Update champions on progress
- Manage executive reviews
- Intervene when customers stall
- Leverage customer marketing (case studies, testimonials)

### Element 7: INSTRUMENTATION
- Collect interaction data across the entire lifecycle
- Product usage, communication records, system integrations
- Can be as simple as a spreadsheet; does not require expensive software

### Element 8: OPERATIONALIZATION
- Act on instrumented data through systematic processes
- Combine technology and human touches based on segment
- Warning: Do NOT over-deliver. Provide what is "appropriate" for the segment to maintain profitability

## 1.3 Gainsight's Customer Success Elements Framework

**Source: [Gainsight Essential Guide](https://www.gainsight.com/essential-guide/customer-success/)**

**16 Elements across 4 Maturity Stages:**

| Stage | Description | Key Elements |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| **Reactive** | No formal CS process | Starting point |
| **Insights & Actions** | Broad view of customer data | Adoption Management, Health Scoring, Customer 360 |
| **Outcomes** | Proactive and prescriptive | Renewal Management, Expansion Management, Onboarding |
| **Transform** | Client-centric culture | Services Experience, Product Success, Advocate Engagement, Tech Touch |

## 1.4 Building a CS Function in a Small Company ($500K-$10M)

**Source: [SaaStr](https://www.saastr.com/customer-success-is-a-single-digit-hire/), [OpenView Partners](https://openviewpartners.com/blog/when-and-how-to-make-your-first-customer-success-hire/)**

### When to Hire Your First CSM
- As soon as you have 1 large client or a handful of medium clients
- Should be a "single-digit hire" (within your first 10 employees)
- **Do NOT wait** until churn becomes a problem

### Hiring Profile
- Must have prior CS experience (do not hire untested)
- Must be trusted by customers to solve problems
- In small companies, the CSM wears multiple hats: onboarding, support, expansion, renewals

### Account Load Guidelines

| Company Stage | Accounts per CSM | Book of Business |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Early (< $1M) | 15-25 (high-touch) | $500K-$2M |
| Growth ($1M-$5M) | 25-35 (mixed touch) | $1.2M-$5M |
| Scale ($5M-$10M) | 35-50 (mix of high/mid/low) | $5M-$10M |

**Critical Rule:** More than 50 accounts per CSM and the ability to proactively engage diminishes significantly.

### First 90 Days of Building CS Function

**Days 1-30: Foundation**
- Audit all existing client relationships (health, contract terms, satisfaction)
- Build client roster with key details (revenue, tenure, contacts, risk level)
- Create basic health score (even a simple spreadsheet Red/Yellow/Green)
- Identify top 5 at-risk clients and intervene immediately

**Days 31-60: Process**
- Define onboarding process and checklist
- Create first QBR template and schedule
- Implement NPS survey
- Build success plan template
- Document expansion opportunities in pipeline

**Days 61-90: Scale**
- Run first round of QBRs
- Analyze NPS results and close feedback loops
- Create playbooks for: onboarding, renewal, expansion, at-risk
- Present CS metrics to leadership (NRR, health scores, NPS)

## 1.5 Onboarding Process That Drives Retention

**Sources: [Dock.us](https://www.dock.us/library/client-onboarding-process), [Gainsight](https://www.gainsight.com/blog/customer-onboarding-template/), [Nextiva](https://www.nextiva.com/blog/customer-onboarding-process.html)**

### The 7-Step Client Onboarding Process

```
PHASE 1: PRE-ONBOARDING (Before Day 1)
========================================
- Send welcome email with: timeline, what to expect, who they'll work with
- Share access credentials / portal login
- Collect required information (data, logins, org chart, stakeholder list)
- Schedule kickoff meeting
- Internal handoff from sales to CS (including Desired Outcome document)

PHASE 2: KICKOFF MEETING (Day 1-3)
====================================
Agenda (60 minutes):
- Introductions and role clarity (10 min)
- Confirm Desired Outcome and success metrics (15 min)
- Walk through onboarding timeline and milestones (10 min)
- Discuss communication cadence and preferences (10 min)
- Assign action items and responsibilities (10 min)
- Q&A (5 min)

PHASE 3: FOUNDATION BUILDING (Week 1-2)
=========================================
- Complete technical setup / data migration
- Train key users on tools, processes, or deliverables
- Establish baseline metrics
- Create shared project workspace (Notion, Asana, Monday, etc.)

PHASE 4: FIRST VALUE DELIVERY (Week 2-4)
==========================================
- Deliver first tangible win (quick win / early deliverable)
- Validate results with client stakeholder
- Document the win for future QBR presentation
- Send "First Win" celebration email

PHASE 5: PROGRESS CHECK (Day 30)
==================================
- 30-day check-in call
- Review progress against milestones
- Identify and remove blockers
- Confirm satisfaction and gather feedback
- Adjust plan if needed

PHASE 6: ADOPTION DEEPENING (Day 31-60)
=========================================
- Ensure all stakeholders are engaged
- Expand usage to additional team members or departments
- Provide advanced training or resources
- Monitor engagement metrics

PHASE 7: TRANSITION TO STEADY STATE (Day 60-90)
=================================================
- 90-day success review meeting
- Confirm Required Outcome progress
- Transition from onboarding cadence to ongoing cadence
- Schedule first QBR
- Introduce expansion topics ("Now that we've achieved X...")
```

### Time-to-First-Value (TTFV) Optimization

**Target: Deliver first tangible value within 14 days of kickoff.**

| Strategy | Action | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Pre-load work | Complete internal prep before kickoff so Day 1 is productive | Saves 3-5 days |
| Quick win identification | During sales, identify one fast deliverable | Creates momentum |
| Reduce client dependencies | Minimize what you need FROM them before you can deliver | Removes bottleneck |
| Parallel workstreams | Run discovery and first delivery simultaneously | Cuts timeline 40% |
| Templatize | Use proven templates instead of starting from scratch | Saves 5-10 days |

**Key Insight:** Customers who experience short time-to-value are significantly less likely to churn. The first "win" is the most powerful predictor of a successful, long-term relationship.

# 3. NPS IMPLEMENTATION

## 3.1 NPS for Service Businesses

**Sources: [ClearlyRated](https://www.clearlyrated.com/blog/net-promoter-score), [Gainsight](https://www.gainsight.com/blog/best-time-to-send-nps-survey-how-to-maximize-responses/), [CustomerGauge](https://customergauge.com/blog/nps-survey-best-practices)**

### The NPS Question
> "On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend [Company Name] to a friend or colleague?"

### Follow-Up Question (Required)
> "What is the primary reason for your score?"

### Optional Third Question
> "What is one thing we could do to improve your experience?"

### NPS Calculation
```
NPS = % Promoters (9-10) - % Detractors (0-6)

Example:
- 100 responses
- 60 Promoters (60%)
- 25 Passives (25%)
- 15 Detractors (15%)
- NPS = 60% - 15% = +45
```

---

## 3.2 Survey Timing & Frequency

| Survey Type | When to Send | Frequency | Purpose |
|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Relational NPS** | Quarterly (same time each quarter) | Every 90 days | Track overall relationship health |
| **Transactional NPS** | After key milestones (project completion, onboarding) | After each event | Measure specific interaction quality |
| **Annual NPS** | Same month each year | Annually | Year-over-year tracking |

### Optimal Send Time
- **Day:** Tuesday or Wednesday
- **Time:** 9:00-11:00 AM in client's time zone
- **Avoid:** Mondays, Fridays, holidays, month-end/quarter-end

### Who to Survey
- All key stakeholders (not just your primary contact)
- Executive sponsors
- Day-to-day users
- Decision makers
- **Target:** 3-5 contacts per client minimum

### Response Rate Targets
- **Professional Services:** 40-60% response rate is excellent
- **General B2B:** 30%+ is considered good
- **Key insight:** Each additional question beyond the NPS question reduces response rate by ~10%

---

## 3.5 NPS and Retention/Expansion Relationship

**Sources: [Paddle/ProfitWell](https://www.paddle.com/studios/shows/profitwell-report/nps-retention), [CustomerGauge](https://customergauge.com/blog/nps-impact-on-revenue)**

### NPS and Retention
- NPS alone is NOT a strong predictor of basic retention
- HOWEVER, companies in the upper quartile of industry NPS have 5-10% higher retention on an absolute basis
- The relationship strengthens when NPS is combined with other health score inputs

### NPS and Expansion Revenue
| NPS Quartile | Median Expansion Revenue (% of Monthly Revenue) |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Lower Quartile | 9% |
| Mid-Range | 14% |
| Upper Quartile | 24% |

**Critical Data Point:** A 10-point NPS increase correlates with a 3.2% increase in upsell revenue (CustomerGauge / Bain research).

### NPS and Advocacy
- NPS accounts for 10-70% of revenue growth variation among direct competitors (Bain & Company)
- Promoters are 4.2x more likely to buy again and 5.6x more likely to forgive a company mistake

# 4. EXPANSION REVENUE

## 4.1 Expansion Revenue Fundamentals

**Sources: [Vitally](https://www.vitally.io/post/upselling-cross-selling-and-renewals-comparing-3-vital-components-of-expansion-revenue), [DemandFarm](https://www.demandfarm.com/blog/land-and-expand/)**

### Three Types of Expansion Revenue

| Type | Definition | Service Business Example |
|------|-----------|------------------------|
| **Upsell** | Selling more of the same service or a premium version | Client upgrades from monthly advisory to weekly advisory + implementation |
| **Cross-sell** | Selling a different, complementary service | Financial planning client adds tax preparation services |
| **Seat/Volume Expansion** | Expanding to more users, departments, or locations | Consulting engagement expands from one division to three |

### Critical Benchmark
> "Most successful growth companies generate 80% of their value by unlocking new revenue from existing customers."

---

## 4.2 When to Present Upsells (Specific Triggers & Timing)

### Timing Rules

**DO present expansion when:**
- Client has achieved their initial Required Outcome (success confirmed)
- Client explicitly mentions a new problem or need during a QBR
- Client's business has changed (new funding, growth, M&A, new leadership)
- Health score is GREEN (75+)
- NPS is 8+ (Promoter or high Passive)
- Client has been a customer for 90+ days
- Contract renewal is 60-90 days away

**DO NOT present expansion when:**
- Health score is Yellow or Red
- There are unresolved support issues
- NPS is 6 or below (Detractor)
- During onboarding (first 60 days)
- Client has expressed budget concerns
- You have not delivered on current commitments

### Specific Expansion Triggers

```
EXPANSION SIGNAL TRIGGERS
===========================

STRONG SIGNALS (Act within 1 week):
1. Client says: "We need help with X" (unsolicited request)
2. Client's company announces funding round or growth
3. Client refers you to another department
4. Executive sponsor asks about additional services
5. Client achieves a major milestone or ROI event

MODERATE SIGNALS (Discuss at next scheduled touchpoint):
6. Client is hiring for roles related to your services
7. Client mentions competitor or alternative for adjacent service
8. Usage/engagement increasing beyond current scope
9. Multiple stakeholders engaging (sign of expanding influence)
10. Client shares strategic plans that align with your capabilities

WEAK SIGNALS (Monitor and nurture):
11. Client attends your webinars or events
12. Client engages with your content (downloads, opens)
13. Industry changes create new needs
14. Regulatory changes require additional compliance services
```

## 4.3 The "Land and Expand" Playbook for Services

**Source: [DemandFarm](https://www.demandfarm.com/blog/land-and-expand/), [HubSpot](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/land-and-expand)**

### Three Foundational Rules
1. Efficient selling involves natural progression -- do not push early expansion
2. Selling too much too soon undermines deals
3. Current customers are the best income source

### Phase 1: LAND (Months 1-3)
```
OBJECTIVE: Win an initial engagement and deliver exceptional value

ACTIONS:
- Identify ONE strong value proposition (don't try to sell everything)
- Start with a smaller, lower-risk engagement
- Price the initial engagement to reduce decision friction
- Deliver results that EXCEED expectations
- Build trust as the foundational currency
- Identify multiple stakeholders early
- Document every win and metric

CRITICAL METRIC: Time-to-First-Value (target: <14 days)
```

### Phase 2: ESTABLISH (Months 3-6)
```
OBJECTIVE: Deepen relationships and demonstrate ongoing value

ACTIONS:
- Run first QBR showing quantified ROI
- Get NPS feedback (target: 9-10)
- Meet additional stakeholders and decision makers
- Understand client's broader organizational challenges
- Position yourself as a strategic advisor, not just a vendor
- Share relevant industry insights and thought leadership
- Identify power users who can champion your services internally

CRITICAL METRIC: Health Score stays GREEN (75+)
```

### Phase 3: EXPAND (Months 6-12+)
```
OBJECTIVE: Grow the account through natural extension of value

THREE EXPANSION MOTIONS:

1. SELL-UP (Upsell)
   - Upgrade scope, frequency, or seniority of engagement
   - Example: "Based on our results, we recommend adding strategic
     planning sessions to accelerate your growth further"

2. SELL-ACROSS (Cross-sell)
   - Introduce complementary services
   - Example: "Several clients in your situation have also benefited
     from our [adjacent service]. Would it be valuable to explore that?"

3. SELL-WIDE (Department/Division Expansion)
   - Extend to other parts of the organization
   - Example: "Your success in [department] is exactly what [other
     department] is trying to achieve. Would an introduction be helpful?"

CRITICAL METRICS:
- Account revenue growth rate
- Number of services per client
- Number of departments served
- Net Revenue Retention (NRR)
```

## 4.4 Expansion Conversation Scripts

### Script 1: Organic QBR Expansion
```
CSM: "Looking at your Q3 results, you've exceeded your target for
[KPI] by 15%. Congratulations.

Now, you mentioned earlier that [specific challenge] is becoming a
priority for next quarter. We've helped several similar clients
tackle that through our [specific service].

For example, [Client X] was in a similar position and saw [specific
result] within [timeframe].

Would it be valuable to explore how that might work for you? I could
put together a brief proposal by next week."
```

### Script 2: Proactive Expansion (Based on Signal)
```
CSM: "[Name], I noticed that your team has grown from 15 to 25
people this quarter -- congratulations on the growth.

With that kind of scaling, many of our clients find that their
[process/system] needs to evolve too. We have a [specific service]
that's designed exactly for companies at your stage.

Would it make sense to have a 20-minute call to see if there's a
fit? No pressure either way -- I just want to make sure you have
what you need."
```

### Script 3: Department Expansion
```
CSM: "[Name], the results we've achieved in [current department]
have been really strong -- [specific metric].

I know you mentioned that [other department/team] is dealing with
[similar challenge]. I'd love to see if we can replicate this
success there too.

Would you be open to making an introduction to [person in other
department]? I can handle the conversation from there so it
doesn't take up your time."
```

### Script 4: Renewal + Expansion
```
CSM: "[Name], your renewal is coming up in [X weeks]. Before we
formalize that, I wanted to share something.

Over the past year, we've delivered [specific ROI]. Given your
plans for [stated goal], there's an opportunity to [expand
scope/add service] that would help you get there faster.

Here's what that could look like: [brief description and expected
impact]. Shall I include this in the renewal proposal, or would
you prefer to discuss it separately?"
```

## 4.5 Net Revenue Retention (NRR) Benchmarks & Calculation

**Sources: [Workday](https://blog.workday.com/en-us/how-to-calculate-net-revenue-retention.html), [MetricHQ](https://www.metrichq.org/saas/net-revenue-retention-rate/), [Deltek](https://www.deltek.com/en/blog/professional-services-benchmarks), [SaaS Capital](https://www.saas-capital.com/blog-posts/benchmarking-metrics-for-bootstrapped-saas-companies/)**

### NRR Calculation Formula

```
NRR = (Starting Revenue - Churn - Contraction + Expansion) / Starting Revenue x 100

Example:
- Starting MRR: $100,000
- Churn (lost clients): -$5,000
- Contraction (downgrades): -$3,000
- Expansion (upsells + cross-sells): +$15,000
- NRR = ($100,000 - $5,000 - $3,000 + $15,000) / $100,000 = 107%
```

### NRR Benchmarks

| Segment | NRR Benchmark | What It Means |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| Enterprise SaaS | 115-125% | Best-in-class |
| Mid-Market B2B | 105-115% | Strong growth |
| SMB B2B | 90-105% | Healthy |
| Professional Services / Consulting | 85-100% | Typical range |
| Bootstrapped companies ($3M-$20M) | 104% (median) | Benchmark |
| 90th percentile (bootstrapped) | 118% | Top performers |
| Premium valuation threshold | 108-115% | Required for premium multiples |

### Professional Services Context
- Consulting firms average 85% retention in 2025
- NRR above 100% means expansion revenue exceeds churn
- For service businesses, NRR is harder to track formally than SaaS but equally critical
- **Target for service businesses: 95-110% NRR**

### How to Improve NRR for Service Businesses

| Lever | Action | Expected Impact |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| Reduce churn | Implement health scoring + early intervention | +3-5% NRR |
| Reduce contraction | Proactive QBRs demonstrating value | +2-3% NRR |
| Increase expansion | Systematic upsell/cross-sell at success milestones | +5-15% NRR |
| Price increases | Annual 3-5% increases with demonstrated value | +3-5% NRR |

| [ ] Propose advisory board membership                                |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Key Dashboard Design Principles
1. Color-code everything (red/yellow/green at a glance)
2. Show TRENDS, not just current scores (direction matters more than snapshot)
3. Alert queue at the top (action-oriented)
4. Drill-down capability for each client
5. Sortable by any column
6. Renewal date always visible (proximity to renewal + low score = critical)
7. Integrate data from: CRM, project management, NPS tool, billing system

# 6. SUCCESS MILESTONES

## 6.1 Celebrating Client Wins as a Retention Strategy

**Sources: [Outreach](https://www.outreach.io/resources/blog/customer-retention-strategies), [Appcues](https://www.appcues.com/blog/celebrate-user-success-improve-retention), [CustomerGauge](https://customergauge.com/blog/customer-retention-examples)**

### Why Milestones Matter
- Celebrating wins reinforces the value of the engagement
- Creates emotional anchors that increase switching costs
- Generates referral momentum (people share wins, not "adequate service")
- Provides natural content for case studies and testimonials
- Reminds clients WHY they work with you (combats "value fade")

CELEBRATION PLAYBOOK
======================

1. THE CONGRATULATIONS EMAIL (Every small win)
   Subject: "Milestone Hit: [Specific Achievement]!"
   Body: "[Name], I wanted to personally highlight that we just hit
   [milestone]. Your team's effort on [specific contribution] made
   this possible. Here's what it means for your business: [impact].
   Looking forward to the next milestone!"

2. THE LINKEDIN SHOUT-OUT (Medium wins, with permission)

   "Dear [Name], I wanted to personally congratulate you on
   [achievement]. The results your team has achieved are
   outstanding. We're honored to be your partner in this

   - Milestones achieved
   - Testimonials from their team about the partnership

## 6.4 How Milestones Drive Referrals

### The Milestone-to-Referral Pipeline

```
MILESTONE --> CELEBRATION --> ADVOCACY ASK --> REFERRAL

Step 1: Achieve a milestone
Step 2: Celebrate it genuinely (NOT transactionally)
Step 3: Wait 1-2 weeks after celebration
Step 4: Make the ask:

REFERRAL ASK SCRIPT:
"[Name], given the results we've achieved together -- especially
[specific milestone] -- I wanted to ask: do you know anyone in
your network who might be dealing with similar challenges?

We've found that the best way to find clients who are a great
fit is through introductions from partners like you who've
experienced the results firsthand.

No pressure at all -- but if someone comes to mind, I'd really
appreciate an introduction."

ALTERNATIVE (for Promoter NPS respondents):
"You mentioned in your recent feedback that you'd recommend us.
Is there anyone specific you'd feel comfortable introducing us to?
Even a warm email introduction would be incredibly helpful."
```

### Referral Program Structure for Service Businesses

| Tier | Trigger | Reward | Follow-Up |
|------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Informal | Client casually mentions a contact | Thank-you email + keep them updated | Report back on outcome |
| Warm Introduction | Client sends email intro | Handwritten thank-you + $100 gift card/donation | Share how the intro went |
| Active Referral | Client actively sells you to their contact | Premium gift + revenue share consideration + exclusive access | VIP treatment going forward |
| Advocate | Client regularly refers (3+ per year) | Advisory board invitation + annual appreciation event + co-branding | Partnership-level relationship |

### When to Capture a Success Story
- After a major milestone is achieved
- When client gives NPS of 9-10
- After client provides an unsolicited testimonial
- At 6-month or 1-year anniversary
- After expansion (proves ongoing value)

### 5-Step Success Story Capture Process

```
STEP 1: IDENTIFY AND QUALIFY (1 day)
======================================
- Confirm client meets criteria:
  [ ] Health score GREEN (80+)
  [ ] NPS 9-10
  [ ] Measurable results to share
  [ ] Willing to be named publicly
  [ ] No NDA restrictions

- Internal prep:
  [ ] Gather all performance data
  [ ] Document key milestones and timeline
  [ ] Identify the "story arc" (challenge > solution > result)
  [ ] Check with sales team for any sensitivities

STEP 2: ASK FOR PERMISSION (1 email)
======================================
Subject: "Would you be open to sharing your success story?"

"[Name], the results we've achieved together have been outstanding
-- [specific metric].

We'd love to feature your story as a case study to help others
learn from your experience. It typically involves a 20-30 minute
interview (we do all the writing), and we'll share the draft with
you for approval before publishing anything.

Would you be open to this? It's also a great way to showcase your
team's accomplishments."

STEP 3: CONDUCT THE INTERVIEW (30 minutes)
=============================================

Interview Framework:

SECTION A: BACKGROUND (5 minutes)
- "Tell me about your role and responsibilities."
- "What does your company do, and who do you serve?"

SECTION B: THE CHALLENGE (8 minutes)
- "What challenges were you facing before working with us?"
- "How were those challenges impacting your business?"
- "What had you tried before that didn't work?"
- "What was the cost of NOT solving this problem?"

SECTION C: WHY US (5 minutes)
- "Why did you choose to work with us?"
- "What other options did you consider?"
- "What stood out about our approach?"

SECTION D: THE SOLUTION & PROCESS (5 minutes)
- "Walk me through how we worked together."
- "What was the onboarding/implementation experience like?"
- "How did your team respond to the changes?"

SECTION E: THE RESULTS (7 minutes)
- "What specific results have you seen?"
- "Can you quantify the impact? (numbers, percentages, dollars)"
- "What surprised you most about the results?"
- "How has this impacted other areas of your business?"

SECTION F: THE RECOMMENDATION (5 minutes)
- "Would you recommend us? Why?"
- "What advice would you give to someone considering this?"
- "What would you say to someone who's skeptical?"

STEP 4: WRITE AND DESIGN (3-5 business days)
================================================
Case Study Structure:
1. Headline: "[Client Name] Achieves [Specific Result] with [Your Company]"
2. Client overview (2-3 sentences)
3. The Challenge (2-3 paragraphs)
4. The Solution (2-3 paragraphs)
5. The Results (with metrics in bold/callout boxes)
6. Client Quote (pull quote for emphasis)
7. Call to Action

STEP 5: REVIEW, APPROVE, AND DISTRIBUTE (1-2 weeks)
=====================================================
- Send draft to client for review and approval
- Make requested edits
- Get final sign-off (written confirmation)
- Publish and distribute:
  [ ] Website case study page
  [ ] Sales enablement materials
  [ ] Email to prospects in similar industries
  [ ] LinkedIn post (tag client with permission)
  [ ] QBR presentations (as benchmarking example)
  [ ] Proposal appendix for new business
```
