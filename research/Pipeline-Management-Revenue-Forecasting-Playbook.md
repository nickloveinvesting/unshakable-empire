---

# 2. WEIGHTED PIPELINE VALUE

## The Core Formula

```
Weighted Pipeline Value = SUM of (Deal Value x Stage Probability) for all open deals
```

### Stage Probability Assignments

| Stage | Probability % | Rationale |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| 1. Prospecting | 5% | Just identified; no engagement confirmed |
| 2. Discovery | 10% | First meeting held, but no qualification |
| 3. Qualification | 20% | BANT confirmed; real opportunity |
| 4. Needs Assessment | 35% | Deep scoping; mutual investment of time |
| 5. Proposal | 50% | Formal proposal delivered; coin flip |
| 6. Negotiation | 75% | Active terms discussion; strong intent |
| 7. Verbal Commit | 90% | Agreed; awaiting paperwork |
| 8. Closed-Won | 100% | Signed contract |

### Full Example Calculation

**Scenario:** A consultancy has the following pipeline at end of month:

| Deal | Stage | Deal Value | Probability | Weighted Value |
|------|-------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Acme Corp - Strategy Engagement | Proposal | $120,000 | 50% | $60,000 |
| Beta LLC - Digital Transformation | Negotiation | $85,000 | 75% | $63,750 |
| Gamma Inc - Ops Assessment | Qualification | $200,000 | 20% | $40,000 |
| Delta Co - Talent Advisory | Verbal Commit | $55,000 | 90% | $49,500 |
| Epsilon Group - Market Entry | Discovery | $150,000 | 10% | $15,000 |
| Zeta Partners - Tech Audit | Needs Assessment | $95,000 | 35% | $33,250 |
| Eta Corp - Change Mgmt | Prospecting | $180,000 | 5% | $9,000 |
| Theta Inc - M&A Due Diligence | Proposal | $250,000 | 50% | $125,000 |

**Results:**
- **Raw Pipeline Value:** $1,135,000
- **Weighted Pipeline Value:** $395,500
- **If quarterly quota is $300,000:**
  - Raw Pipeline Coverage: 3.78x (healthy)
  - Weighted Pipeline Coverage: 1.32x (needs more pipeline)

### When and How to Update Weights

**UPDATE PROBABILITY WEIGHTS:**

1. **Quarterly Review:** Compare your actual stage-to-stage conversion rates against assigned probabilities. If your historical data shows that only 40% of proposals close (not 50%), adjust down to 40%.

2. **Formula for Recalibrating:**
```
New Stage Probability = (Deals Won from This Stage / Total Deals that Entered This Stage) x 100
```

3. **Annual Recalibration:** At minimum, recalibrate annually using 12 months of CRM data.

4. **Segment by Deal Size:** Maintain separate probability tables for small (<$75K), mid ($75K-$200K), and large ($200K+) deals if your data shows meaningfully different close rates.

5. **Override Rules:** Allow manager override of stage probability for specific deals (e.g., a Proposal-stage deal with confirmed verbal commitment might be manually weighted at 70% instead of the standard 50%).

## Pipeline Coverage Ratio

### Formula
```
Pipeline Coverage Ratio = Total Pipeline Value / Sales Quota for Period
```

### How Much Pipeline Do You Need?

| Win Rate | Required Coverage Ratio | Pipeline Needed for $500K Quota |
|----------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 20% | 5.0x | $2,500,000 |
| 25% | 4.0x | $2,000,000 |
| 33% | 3.0x | $1,500,000 |
| 40% | 2.5x | $1,250,000 |
| 50% | 2.0x | $1,000,000 |

### Coverage by Business Segment

| Segment | Recommended Coverage |
|---------|---------------------|
| SMB (shorter cycles) | 2.5-3.0x |
| Mid-Market | 3.0-4.0x |
| Enterprise | 4.0-5.0x |
| New logo / first-time buyers | 4.0-5.0x |
| Existing client expansion | 2.0-3.0x |

# 3. WEEKLY PIPELINE REVIEW MEETING

## Meeting Purpose
Review deal health, identify stuck opportunities, coach reps on next actions, and validate the forecast.

## Core Principle
**70% coaching, 30% inspection.** Most time is spent asking guiding questions and strategizing -- not just checking data hygiene.

---

## 30-MINUTE PIPELINE REVIEW (1-on-1 with Rep)

| Time | Section | What Happens |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **0:00-4:00** | **Pipeline Snapshot** | Manager pulls up the CRM dashboard. Review total pipeline value, weighted value, pipeline coverage ratio, and deals added/lost since last week. Manager asks: "What changed in your pipeline this week?" |
| **4:00-11:00** | **Top 3 Deals Review (Deal #1)** | Rep gives 60-second deal summary: what happened, what's next, what's blocking. Manager asks MEDDPICC-based questions (see Section 7). Focus on ONE action that moves this deal forward this week. |
| **11:00-18:00** | **Top 3 Deals Review (Deals #2 and #3)** | Same format. 3.5 minutes each. Quick summary, one key question, one action item. |
| **18:00-24:00** | **Stuck/At-Risk Deals** | Review any deal that has exceeded max stage duration (see Stage Duration table). Manager asks: "What has to be true for this deal to close by [date]? Is that realistic?" Decision: accelerate, re-engage, or remove. |
| **24:00-28:00** | **Pipeline Generation** | Review prospecting activity from the past week. How many new opportunities entered the pipe? Is coverage ratio healthy? If below 3x, discuss specific prospecting actions for the coming week. |
| **28:00-30:00** | **Action Items Recap** | Rep summarizes commitments in their own words. Manager confirms. All action items logged in CRM with owner and due date. |

---

## 45-MINUTE PIPELINE REVIEW (Team Meeting, 3-5 Reps)

| Time | Section | What Happens |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **0:00-5:00** | **Team Metrics Review** | Manager presents: total team pipeline, weighted value, deals won this period, forecast vs. target, pipeline coverage. No individual call-outs -- just the numbers. |
| **5:00-10:00** | **Wins & Lessons** | Any deals closed since last meeting? 2-minute win story: what worked? One transferable lesson the team can apply. |
| **10:00-15:00** | **Forecast Category Roll-Up** | Each rep states their Commit, Best Case, and Upside numbers for the period. Manager captures on a shared board. Quick sanity check: does the total match what we need? |
| **15:00-35:00** | **Deal-by-Deal Inspection (Rotating Focus)** | Each rep gets 4-5 minutes to present their #1 priority deal. Format: 90-second summary, then manager + peer coaching. MEDDPICC scorecard used (see below). Focus: "What is the ONE thing that must happen this week to advance this deal?" |
| **35:00-40:00** | **Stuck Deal Triage** | Manager identifies 2-3 stalled deals across the team. Quick vote: accelerate (bring in senior help), re-engage (new approach), or kill (remove from pipeline). |
| **40:00-45:00** | **Action Items & Close** | Each rep states their top 3 actions for the week. Manager confirms. Meeting ends on time. |

---

## 60-MINUTE PIPELINE REVIEW (Full Team + Leadership, Monthly/Quarterly)

| Time | Section | What Happens |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **0:00-10:00** | **Business Review** | Total pipeline health: value by stage, conversion rates this period vs. benchmark, average deal size trend, cycle time trend. Pipeline coverage for next quarter. |
| **10:00-20:00** | **Forecast Presentation** | Manager presents the team forecast: Commit, Best Case, Upside. Comparison to target. Adds/slips/pull-ins since last review. CRO or VP asks: "How confident are you in the Commit number?" |
| **20:00-40:00** | **Deal Deep Dives (3-4 Deals)** | Selected deals that are large, strategic, or at-risk. Full MEDDPICC review for each (5 min per deal). Leadership provides coaching or agrees to executive engagement. |
| **40:00-50:00** | **Pipeline Generation Review** | Inbound vs. outbound mix. Lead source performance. Where are the gaps for next quarter? Specific campaigns or prospecting sprints planned. |
| **50:00-55:00** | **Process Improvements** | What is slowing deals down? Any stage with abnormally high drop-off? Tool or process changes needed? |
| **55:00-60:00** | **Commitments & Close** | Top 5 team-level action items. Owners and deadlines assigned. Next review date confirmed. |

## Questions the Sales Manager Asks About Each Deal

### The 10 Essential Pipeline Review Questions

1. **"Walk me through this deal in 60 seconds -- where are we?"**
   - Forces the rep to be concise and honest about status.

2. **"What changed since last week?"**
   - Identifies momentum (or lack thereof). If nothing changed, that IS the problem.

3. **"Who is the economic buyer, and when did you last speak with them?"**
   - Tests whether the rep has access to the person who signs the check.

4. **"What is the prospect's compelling event or deadline?"**
   - No compelling event = no urgency = deals slip indefinitely.

5. **"What are they comparing us against?"**
   - If the rep says "nothing" or "I don't know," the deal is not qualified.

6. **"What has to be true for this to close by [date]?"**
   - Forces the rep to map remaining steps realistically.

7. **"What is the next concrete action, and when will it happen?"**
   - Not "I'll follow up." Instead: "I have a call with their CFO on Thursday at 2pm to review the SOW."

8. **"What could kill this deal?"**
   - Surfaces risks the rep may be minimizing.

9. **"If you were the prospect, would YOU buy this right now? Why or why not?"**
   - Forces empathy and honest assessment.

10. **"On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you this closes on time and at value? Why not higher?"**
    - The "why not higher" follow-up is where the real coaching happens.

# 4. FORECASTING FRAMEWORK

## Forecast Categories: Exact Definitions

### COMMIT (Confidence: 90%+)

**Definition:** The final decision-maker has committed to closing the deal. Only an unpredictable and dramatic change in circumstances would stop it.

**Criteria -- ALL must be true:**
- [ ] Economic buyer has verbally or in writing committed to proceeding
- [ ] Terms finalized (price, scope, timeline agreed)
- [ ] Competition eliminated (they have chosen you)
- [ ] Legal/procurement hurdles cleared or in final review
- [ ] Only contract execution remains
- [ ] Close date is within the current period
- [ ] Rep has a documented, credible close plan with specific remaining steps and dates
- [ ] MEDDPICC score of 14+ out of 16

**Expected close rate for Commit deals: 80-90%**

The remaining 10-20% typically still close after a short delay (1-2 weeks), not as losses.

---

### BEST CASE (Confidence: 60-80%)

**Definition:** A fully qualified opportunity where you are the preferred vendor ("Column A"). There is work to do, but the deal has a clear path to close within the period.

**Criteria -- MOST must be true:**
- [ ] Prospect has confirmed you as the preferred solution
- [ ] Budget confirmed and allocated
- [ ] Decision criteria met; proposal accepted in principle
- [ ] Decision process mapped; clear sequence of steps to close
- [ ] Champion actively engaged and advocating internally
- [ ] Close date is in the current period, achievable with known remaining steps
- [ ] MEDDPICC score of 10-13 out of 16

**Expected close rate for Best Case deals: 33-50%**

---

### UPSIDE / LONG-SHOT (Confidence: 10-30%)

**Definition:** A deal with a realistic possibility of closing within the period, but not yet sufficiently validated to be a Best Case. Everything would need to go well.

**Criteria:**
- [ ] Opportunity is qualified (BANT confirmed)
- [ ] The prospect has ruled out "do nothing" as an option
- [ ] Active evaluation underway, but competition may be strong
- [ ] Budget exists but may not yet be fully allocated
- [ ] Decision timeline exists but may be aspirational
- [ ] Significant MEDDPICC gaps remain (score 6-9)
- [ ] Close is possible but requires favorable conditions

**Expected close rate for Upside deals: 10-25%**

---

### PIPELINE (Confidence: <10%)

**Definition:** Early-stage opportunities in the buying process that require further development. No realistic possibility of closing in the current period.

**Criteria:**
- [ ] Deal is in Stages 1-3 (Prospecting through Qualification)
- [ ] MEDDPICC score below 6
- [ ] No confirmed decision timeline for this period
- [ ] Still building relationships and understanding needs

**Expected close rate this period: <5%**

```

---

## The "Call" Process: How Managers Validate Rep Forecasts

### Step 1: Pre-Call Preparation (Manager, 15 min before meeting)
- Pull CRM report: all deals in Commit and Best Case
- Flag deals with: close date changed more than once, days in stage exceeding benchmark, no activity in 7+ days, MEDDPICC score below 10
- Identify the 3-5 deals that need the deepest inspection

### Step 2: Deal Inspection (During Pipeline Review)
For each Commit deal, the manager asks:
1. "When is the contract being signed? What is the exact date?"
2. "Who is signing it? Have you confirmed this with them directly?"
3. "What could prevent this from closing on that date?"
4. "Has the close date moved before? How many times?"
5. "What was the last substantive interaction? When?"

**Red flags that trigger a downgrade:**
- Close date has moved 2+ times
- No contact with economic buyer in 14+ days
- Legal/procurement not yet engaged for deals "closing this month"
- Rep cannot articulate the remaining steps with dates

### Step 3: Bias Tracking (Rolling Quarterly)
Track each rep's historical accuracy:

```
REP FORECAST ACCURACY TRACKER
==============================
| Rep | Q1 Commit | Q1 Actual | Accuracy | Bias |
|-----|-----------|-----------|----------|------|
| Rep A | $200K   | $180K     | 90%      | Over-forecasts by 10% |
| Rep B | $150K   | $170K     | 88%      | Under-forecasts by 13% |
| Rep C | $180K   | $120K     | 67%      | Over-forecasts by 33% -- COACHING NEEDED |
```

Apply historical bias as a correction factor in the manager roll-up.

## Forecast Accuracy Benchmarks

| Performance Tier | Accuracy | What It Means |
|-----------------|----------|---------------|
| **World-Class** | 95%+ | Unified systems, AI-powered insights, single source of truth |
| **Good** | 85-95% | Dedicated tools, disciplined sales process |
| **Acceptable** | 80-85% | Manual data entry, some disconnected systems |
| **Poor** | Below 80% | No process, gut-feel forecasting |

### Acceptable Variance by Segment

| Segment | Acceptable Variance |
|---------|-------------------|
| Enterprise | +/- 10% |
| Mid-Market | +/- 15-20% |
| SMB | +/- 20-30% |

# 5. STUCK DEAL IDENTIFICATION

## Time-Based Triggers: "How Long Is Too Long?"

Use the **1.5x Rule:** If a deal exceeds 1.5x the average days in stage, it is flagged as "at risk." If it exceeds 2x the average, it is flagged as "stalled" and requires immediate manager intervention.

| Pipeline Stage | Avg. Days (Mid-Market) | At-Risk Trigger (1.5x) | Stalled Trigger (2x) |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Prospecting | 10 days | 15 days | 20 days |
| Discovery | 7 days | 11 days | 14 days |
| Qualification | 10 days | 15 days | 20 days |
| Needs Assessment | 17 days | 26 days | 34 days |
| Proposal | 17 days | 26 days | 34 days |
| Negotiation | 21 days | 32 days | 42 days |
| Verbal Commit | 10 days | 15 days | 20 days |

**Critical Benchmark:** If a deal has been in Negotiation for 90 days when your average is 14-21, that is a dead deal unless you can identify a specific, verifiable reason (e.g., government procurement process, fiscal year budget cycle).

---

## Activity-Based Triggers: Signals a Deal Is Dying

### Engagement Drop-Off Signals

| Signal | What It Means | Action |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **No email opens/replies in 10+ days** | Prospect has gone dark | Send a "breakup email" or try a different contact |
| **Champion stopped responding** | Internal priority shifted or champion lost influence | Reach out to a different stakeholder; ask champion directly what changed |
| **Meetings cancelled or rescheduled 2+ times** | You are not a priority | Ask directly: "Has something changed on your end?" |
| **No new stakeholders introduced** | Deal is not progressing internally | Push for multi-threading: "Who else should we include?" |
| **Prospect stops asking questions** | They have already decided (likely against you) | Force a candid conversation about where you stand |
| **Close date pushed 2+ times** | The timeline was never real | Requalify: "What needs to happen for you to have budget/approval by [new date]?" |
| **Proposal sent but no feedback in 14+ days** | Proposal is sitting unread or was forwarded and lost | Call (don't email). Ask: "What questions came up when you reviewed it?" |
| **Legal/procurement not engaged 14+ days before "close date"** | Close date is unrealistic | Reset expectations. Map the actual remaining steps with dates. |

---

## The "Dead Deal" Criteria Checklist

**A deal should be marked CLOSED-LOST or moved to NURTURE if ANY of the following are true:**

### Definitive Kill Criteria (Remove Immediately)
- [ ] Prospect explicitly says "no" or "we chose another vendor"
- [ ] Prospect's company went through a major event (acquisition, bankruptcy, leadership change) that eliminates the project
- [ ] Budget has been formally cancelled or reallocated
- [ ] The champion has left the organization and no new champion exists
- [ ] The prospect has gone completely dark: no response to 5+ outreach attempts across multiple channels over 30+ days

### Probable Kill Criteria (Remove Unless Manager Can Identify a Save Plan)
- [ ] Deal has exceeded 2x average stage duration with no meaningful activity
- [ ] Close date has been pushed 3+ times
- [ ] No contact with economic buyer in 30+ days
- [ ] MEDDPICC score has degraded (was 10+, now below 6) due to stakeholder changes
- [ ] Prospect said "not now" with no specific re-engagement date
- [ ] You cannot identify who your champion is

                                                  CLOSE-LOST
```

### Nurture Track Rules
When a deal is moved to nurture (not active pipeline):
1. Remove from active pipeline calculations and forecast
2. Set a specific re-engagement date (30, 60, or 90 days)
3. Add to automated nurture email sequence (monthly value-add content)
4. Calendar reminder for personal outreach at re-engagement date
5. Monitor for trigger events (new leadership, funding round, expansion announcement)

# 6. DAILY PIPELINE HYGIENE

## The Rep's Morning Routine: 15-20 Minutes

**Do this EVERY morning before any other work. Non-negotiable.**

### Minute 0-5: INBOX TRIAGE
- [ ] Review overnight emails from prospects and clients
- [ ] Identify any deal-related responses that require same-day action
- [ ] Star/flag urgent items (proposal questions, contract feedback, meeting requests)
- [ ] DO NOT start responding yet -- just triage and prioritize

### Minute 5-10: PIPELINE SCAN
- [ ] Open CRM pipeline view sorted by close date (nearest first)
- [ ] For every deal closing THIS MONTH:
  - Is the next step scheduled on the calendar? If no, that is your first task today.
  - Has anything changed since yesterday? Update the CRM note.
  - Is the close date still realistic? If not, update it NOW (do not wait for the weekly review).
- [ ] Check for any stale deals (exceeding stage duration benchmarks)
- [ ] Check: do I have at least 3x pipeline coverage? If not, prospecting is priority today.

### Minute 10-15: TODAY'S HIT LIST
Build a prioritized list of 3-5 deals to work today using this framework:

**Priority 1 - CLOSE:** Deals in Negotiation or Verbal Commit closing this month. What action moves them to signed?

**Priority 2 - ADVANCE:** Deals in Proposal or Needs Assessment. What action moves them to the next stage?

**Priority 3 - QUALIFY:** Deals in Discovery or Qualification. What action confirms or disqualifies them?

**Priority 4 - GENERATE:** New prospects to contact. Fill the top of the funnel.

### Minute 15-20: QUICK CRM UPDATES
- [ ] Log yesterday's activity: calls made, emails sent, meetings held
- [ ] Update deal notes for any deal you touched yesterday
- [ ] Confirm all next steps have dates and are on your calendar

---

## CRM Fields: Daily vs. Weekly Update Cadence

### DAILY Updates (After Every Prospect Interaction)

| CRM Field | Why Daily |
|-----------|----------|
| **Last Activity Date** | Shows deal is alive; triggers stale alerts if missed |
| **Last Activity Note** | 1-2 sentence summary of what happened and what was learned |
| **Next Step** | Specific, concrete action with a date (not "follow up") |
| **Next Step Date** | Must always be in the future; if it's in the past, deal is stale |
| **Stage** | Move immediately when exit criteria are met; do not batch stage changes |
| **Contact Role** | Update as new stakeholders are identified |
| **Deal Amount** | Update if scope changes during conversation |

### WEEKLY Updates (During Pipeline Review Prep, Friday or Monday)

| CRM Field | Why Weekly |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Close Date** | Adjust based on what you learned this week; only push if justified |
| **Forecast Category** | Commit / Best Case / Upside / Pipeline -- reassess weekly |
| **MEDDPICC Score** | Re-score each element based on latest information |
| **Competitor** | Update if new competitor is identified or eliminated |
| **Decision Process Notes** | Document any new steps, stakeholders, or timeline changes |
| **Risk/Blocker Notes** | Flag anything that could prevent the deal from closing |
| **Champion Status** | Still engaged? Still influential? Any changes? |

### MONTHLY Updates

| CRM Field | Why Monthly |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Account Information** | Company size, industry, key contacts -- refresh for accuracy |
| **Lead Source Attribution** | Confirm original lead source is accurate |
| **Win/Loss Reason** | For closed deals: document the real reason (not "price") |
| **Duplicate Check** | Scan for and merge duplicate contacts or accounts |

---

## Deal Prioritization: The Daily "What Do I Work On?" Matrix

### The Eisenhower Matrix Applied to Deals

| | URGENT (Closing this week/month) | NOT URGENT (Closing next month+) |
|---|---|---|
| **HIGH VALUE (>$100K or strategic)** | **QUADRANT 1: DO FIRST** Late-stage deals with deadlines, legal/procurement blockers, critical client escalations, renewal risks. WORK THESE BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE. | **QUADRANT 2: SCHEDULE** Long-term relationship building, strategic account development, multi-threading into new stakeholders, executive engagement. BLOCK TIME THIS WEEK. |
| **LOWER VALUE (<$100K, transactional)** | **QUADRANT 3: DELEGATE OR BATCH** Admin requests, status updates, non-essential internal meetings, low-impact client requests. BATCH THESE, 30 min in the afternoon. | **QUADRANT 4: ELIMINATE** Unqualified prospects you keep "hoping" will turn around, internal busywork, deals with MEDDPICC score below 5. REMOVE FROM YOUR ATTENTION. |

---

## The "Power Hour" Prospecting Concept

### What It Is
A dedicated, non-negotiable block of 60-90 minutes focused exclusively on outbound prospecting -- cold calls, personalized emails, social selling, and referral requests. No email checking. No Slack. No CRM admin. Pure outbound.

### Structure of a Power Hour

| Phase | Duration | Activity |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Prep** | 15 min | Build or review your call list (10-15 prospects). Research each for 60 seconds. Write a one-line personalized hook for each. |
| **Execute** | 60 min | Make calls, send emails, LinkedIn outreach. Stick to ONE channel per session to build momentum. Target: 15-25 dials or 10-15 personalized emails. |
| **Wrap** | 15 min | Log all activity in CRM. Note outcomes. Reflect: what messaging worked? Schedule follow-ups. |

### Power Hour Rules
1. **Same time every day.** Best results: 8:00-9:30 AM or 4:00-5:30 PM (research shows these windows have highest connect rates).
2. **Never do back-to-back power hours.** One per day is the minimum. Two maximum, with a break between.
3. **Track the numbers.** Dials made, conversations had, meetings booked. Publish weekly to the team for accountability.
4. **Stick to one channel per session.** All phone, or all email, or all LinkedIn. Switching channels kills momentum.

### Power Hour Weekly Targets (Service Business Rep)

| Activity | Daily Target | Weekly Target |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Outbound dials | 15-25 | 75-125 |
| Conversations (connects) | 3-5 | 15-25 |
| Personalized emails | 10-15 | 50-75 |
| LinkedIn touches | 5-10 | 25-50 |
| Meetings booked | 1-2 | 5-10 |
| New opportunities created | 0-1 | 2-4 |

# 7. MEDDPICC QUALIFICATION FRAMEWORK

## Complete Framework Applied to Pipeline Review

### M - METRICS
**What you need to know:** The quantifiable business impact your solution delivers -- ROI, cost savings, revenue increase, efficiency gains, risk reduction.

**Key Questions for Pipeline Review:**
1. "What are the primary metrics you use to gauge success of current operations?"
2. "How do you measure ROI for similar projects?"
3. "What KPIs do you expect this engagement to influence?"
4. "Can you quantify the expected improvements?"
5. "What are the financial implications of NOT addressing this?"
6. "What would it be worth to solve this problem? In dollars per month/quarter/year?"

**Scoring:**
- 0 = No metrics discussed. We are selling features, not outcomes.
- 1 = General value discussed ("it would save us time") but not quantified.
- 2 = Specific, prospect-confirmed metrics with dollar values ("this will save us $200K/year in contractor costs and reduce project delivery time by 30%").

---

### E - ECONOMIC BUYER
**What you need to know:** The person with ultimate decision-making authority AND budget control.

**Key Questions for Pipeline Review:**
1. "Who holds the ultimate budget authority for this purchase?"
2. "What is the approval process for budget allocation?"
3. "Have we met with or presented to the economic buyer directly?"
4. "What are the economic buyer's top priorities this quarter?"
5. "How does the economic buyer evaluate potential solutions?"
6. "If you and I agree, is there anyone else who would need to approve -- formally or informally?"

**Scoring:**

- 1 = Economic buyer identified by name and title, but we have not engaged them.
- 2 = Economic buyer identified, met with, and actively supportive of the initiative.

---

### D - DECISION CRITERIA
**What you need to know:** The specific factors the buyer will use to evaluate and compare vendors.

**Key Questions for Pipeline Review:**
1. "What are the most critical factors in your decision-making for this purchase?"
2. "Are there specific capabilities that are non-negotiable?"
3. "How do you prioritize cost vs. quality vs. speed?"
4. "What weight do you give to each criterion?"
5. "Are there compliance or regulatory requirements we must meet?"
6. "Do you have a formal scoring system for evaluating options?"

- 1 = We know some criteria, but haven't confirmed we meet them or influenced them.
- 2 = We know the full criteria, we meet or exceed them, and we helped shape them.

---

### D - DECISION PROCESS

**What you need to know:** The administrative and procurement process -- how contracts are reviewed, approved, and executed.

**Key Questions for Pipeline Review:**
1. "What does your contract review process look like?"
2. "Does legal need to review? How long does that typically take?"
3. "Is there a procurement or purchasing department involved?"
4. "Do you have standard terms, or will you use ours?"
5. "Are there any required vendor registration or compliance steps?"
6. "What is the fastest you have ever gotten a contract like this signed?"

**Scoring:**
- 0 = We have no idea what happens after verbal agreement.
- 1 = We know legal/procurement is involved but haven't engaged them yet.
- 2 = We have engaged legal/procurement, understand the timeline, and have addressed their requirements.

---

### I - IDENTIFY PAIN
**What you need to know:** The specific business problems the prospect is experiencing, in their own words, with quantified impact.

**Key Questions for Pipeline Review:**
1. "What are the most significant challenges you're facing?"
2. "How do these challenges impact daily operations and overall performance?"
3. "What are the financial implications of these pain points?"
4. "What happens if you don't solve this in the next 6-12 months?"
5. "What attempts have been made to address this in the past? Why didn't they work?"

- 2 = We have an influential champion who is actively selling internally, coaching us, and has a personal stake in our success.

---

### C - COMPETITION

**Key Questions for Pipeline Review:**
1. "Who else are you evaluating for this project?"
2. "What do you see as the strengths of the other options?"
3. "How do you view our approach compared to theirs?"
4. "Is 'do nothing' or 'build internally' a realistic option?"
5. "What would make you choose us over the alternatives?"
6. "Where do you see us falling short compared to others?"

**Scoring:**
- 0 = We don't know who we're competing against.
- 1 = We know the competitors but haven't differentiated or addressed their strengths.
- 2 = We know every competitor, understand our relative position, the prospect has confirmed our differentiation, and we are the preferred choice.

# 8. FORMULAS & CALCULATIONS REFERENCE

## Core Pipeline Formulas

### 1. Weighted Pipeline Value
```
Weighted Pipeline = SUM( Deal_Value[i] x Stage_Probability[i] )
```

### 2. Pipeline Coverage Ratio
```
Coverage Ratio = Total Active Pipeline Value / Quota for Period
```
Target: 3x-4x for service businesses with 25-33% win rates.

### 3. Pipeline Velocity (Revenue per Day)
```
Pipeline Velocity = (Number of Deals x Average Deal Value x Win Rate) / Average Sales Cycle Length (days)
```
**Example:** (40 deals x $80,000 x 25%) / 90 days = $8,889 revenue generated per day

### 4. Stage Conversion Rate
```
Stage Conversion Rate = (Deals Advancing to Next Stage / Deals Entering This Stage) x 100
```

### 5. Win Rate
```
Win Rate = Closed-Won Deals / (Closed-Won + Closed-Lost) x 100
```
Note: Exclude deals still in pipeline. Only count fully resolved opportunities.

### 6. Average Deal Size
```
Average Deal Size = Total Revenue from Closed-Won Deals / Number of Closed-Won Deals
```

### 7. Sales Cycle Length
```
Average Cycle = SUM( Close_Date[i] - Create_Date[i] ) / Number of Closed Deals
```

### 8. Forecast Accuracy
```
Forecast Accuracy = 1 - ABS( (Forecast - Actual) / Actual )
```
**Example:** Forecast $500K, Actual $450K. Accuracy = 1 - |($500K - $450K) / $450K| = 1 - 0.111 = 88.9%

### 9. Forecast Bias
```
Forecast Bias = (Forecast - Actual) / Actual x 100
```
Positive = over-forecasting. Negative = under-forecasting.

### 10. Most Likely Revenue (Blended Forecast)
```
Most Likely = Closed-Won + (Commit x 0.90) + (Best Case x 0.40) + (Upside x 0.15)
```

### 11. Pipeline Generation Required
```
Required Monthly Pipeline Generation = (Remaining Quota / Win Rate) / Months Remaining
```
**Example:** $300K remaining quota, 25% win rate, 3 months left.
Required = ($300K / 0.25) / 3 = $400K of new pipeline per month.

### 12. Activity-to-Revenue Ratio
```
Revenue per Dial = Closed Revenue / Total Dials Made
Revenue per Meeting = Closed Revenue / Total Meetings Held
Revenue per Proposal = Closed Revenue / Total Proposals Sent
```
Use these to set activity targets that back into revenue goals.
