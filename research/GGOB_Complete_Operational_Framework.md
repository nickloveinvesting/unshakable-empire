## 1. THE HUDDLE SYSTEM

The Huddle System is the communication engine of GGOB. It operates as a three-tier, cascading meeting structure called the "Huddle Cycle" that flows bottom-up (not top-down) through the organization.

### 1A. PRE-HUDDLE (Daily Departmental Huddle)

**Who:** Each department/workgroup team with their senior manager/team lead
**When:** Daily (same time every day)
**Duration:** 7-15 minutes
**Led By:** Senior manager of the workgroup

**Exact Agenda (4-Part Structure):**

1. **Evaluate Game Conditions** -- Share the big picture: where the company is headed, threats, opportunities, operational updates and current marketplace landscape
2. **Check the Score** -- Review workgroup performance on the team scorecard; fill in the individual team scorecard with operational data; develop a financial forecast/opinion from operational performance
3. **Plan the Next Play** -- Determine what plays the team must run to improve the score; identify the "one thing" the team can do to improve the score
4. **Get Fired Up** -- Recognize and celebrate every win, big or small

**Three Discussion Topics Covered:**
- **Ideas:** "What are your suggestions for improvement?"
- **Roadblocks:** "Where are you stuck? What can the team do to help?"
- **Lessons Learned:** "What have you learned that should be shared with everyone?"

**Key Output:** Each department prepares their financial forecast numbers and operational data to communicate upward to the Management Huddle. Line-item owners prepare their forecasts for the week.

**Critical Principle:** Information flows bottom-up. The Pre-Huddle ensures employees understand their numbers, the stories behind those numbers, and are prepared to share how they are impacting The Game and answer questions from other staff.

---

### 1B. MANAGEMENT HUDDLE (Weekly Small Staff Huddle)

**Who:** General Manager + all Pre-Huddle leaders/department heads
**When:** Weekly, after Pre-Huddles are completed
**Duration:** 15-30 minutes
**Led By:** General Manager

**Exact Agenda (mirrors the 3-part Pre-Huddle structure):**

1. **Evaluate Game Conditions** -- Discuss the updates from individual departments; each department leader reports their Pre-Huddle data
2. **Check the Score** -- Review each department's Critical Number; discuss any positive or negative variance from plan; compile all Pre-Huddle data into a comprehensive financial picture
3. **Plan the Next Play** -- Address any changes that need to be made to correct weaknesses or pursue opportunities; decide on big-picture changes

**Key Output:** The management team compiles a complete, company-wide financial forecast from all department inputs. This prepares the management team for the Company-Wide Huddle.

**Critical Principle:** Information is communicated through the company in a bottom-up fashion (as opposed to traditional management systems which filter information from management to employees). Teams who communicate information across various departments are less likely to encounter surprises and are better problem-solvers.

---

### 1C. COMPANY-WIDE HUDDLE (The "Big Huddle" / Main Huddle)

**Who:** ALL employees and ALL managers
**When:** Weekly, same time every week (after Management Huddle)
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes (can extend to 1 hour)
**Led By:** General Manager or other top-level managers

**Exact Agenda:**

1. **Core Values and Purpose** -- Open with company core values and purpose statement
2. **Select Celebration Leader** -- Designate who will lead celebrations/recognitions for the week
3. **Line-Item Forecasting** -- Each line-item owner reports their forecast for how their assigned income statement line will end the month. Numbers are written on a large scoreboard visible to all.
4. **Analysis of Numbers by Senior Leaders** -- Leaders provide context, explain variances, and discuss the story behind the numbers
5. **Department Metrics Rollup** -- Roll up important department metrics
6. **Announcements** -- Company-wide announcements
7. **Core-Value Recognitions** -- Recognize employees who exemplified core values
8. **Financial Literacy Training Bite** -- Brief educational moment: introduce new financial concept, review Word of the Week, or run a quick activity
9. **Celebration** -- Acknowledge wins and reinforce desired behaviors
10. **MiniGame Scoreboard Updates** -- Update progress on active MiniGames

**Materials Provided to Employees:**
- **Game Binders** containing: annual business plan, huddle scoreboards, bonus plan details, business/financial glossary of terms, training bites
- **Blank Scoreboard** each month so employees can track, measure, and report information
- Small prizes/incentives for employees who answer questions or participate actively

**Structure:** Participants organized into small groups or teams, with a manager acting as "Team Captain"

**9 Rules for Making Huddles Work:**
1. Huddle weekly -- people can fall off the wagon in a single week
2. Make the Huddle educational -- incorporate teachable moments
3. Keep it simple -- use simplified financials employees can quickly understand
4. Keep it short and solution-oriented -- publish the agenda, designate a meeting leader, use a stopwatch
5. Ensure attendees leave with the same numbers -- build reports live or use physical scoreboards
6. Practice makes perfect -- conduct mock pre-huddles where managers practice
7. Drill down with Post-Huddles -- hold follow-up department meetings
8. Audit the process -- verify all locations conduct huddles consistently
9. Spread the word -- form coordination teams to promote participation

---

### 1D. POST-HUDDLE (Department Follow-Up)

**Who:** Each department/workgroup (frontline employees, not just managers)
**When:** Immediately following the Company-Wide Huddle
**Duration:** Brief (10-15 minutes)
**Purpose:** Make sure each member of an individual workgroup understands the numbers from the main Huddle

**What Happens:**
1. Review financial highlights from the main Huddle
2. Discuss what is going on in a featured department
3. Introduce a new financial concept via brief activity
4. Recap and brief Q&A on the numbers
5. Connect the company-wide numbers to the specific department's work

---

## 2. THE MINIGAME FRAMEWORK

### Definition
A MiniGame is an engaging, short-term activity designed to pursue an opportunity or correct a weakness within a company. MiniGames are self-funding incentive plans that create quick wins and embody the principle that "People Support What They Help Create."

### Duration
- **Recommended:** 60-90 days (one quarter)
- **Acceptable Range:** 2-6 months
- **Rationale:** It takes approximately 60-90 days for someone to change their habits and behaviors
- **Milestone Structure:** Set milestones each month within the MiniGame timeframe

### The 6 Must-Have Elements

**1. A GOAL**
- Focus on a specific objective achievable within 90 days
- Can address urgent issues or target smaller behaviors that drive the Critical Number
- Must be specific and measurable (e.g., "acquire 10 new customers in 90 days," "reduce scrap by 15%")
- Should answer: What is the general outcome you want to achieve?

**2. A PRODUCER (Champion)**
- The employee responsible for championing this specific MiniGame
- Must have thorough understanding of the drivers, processes, and departments involved
- Keeps the MiniGame on track and maintains energy

**3. A CAST (Players)**
- All employees and management whose actions impact the goal
- Not just the directly responsible department
- Include everyone with a hand in the results to drive behavior change

**4. A THEME**
- Choose a theme that energizes the players and propels The Game overall
- Think of relevant, fun, and trending subjects that motivate the whole team
- The theme drives the scoreboard design and prize structure

**5. REWARDS (Prize Structure)**
- **Preferred:** Non-monetary rewards that are fun and reinforce shared success
- **Examples:** Catered barbecue, "movie day" at work, gift cards, extra time off, team-building events
- **Prize Level Structure (Recommended):** Create progressive reward levels:
  - Level 1: Ball cap
  - Level 2: T-shirt
  - Level 3: Jacket
  - Level 4: Everyone goes to a ballgame together
- **Principle:** Small, frequent wins along the way with the biggest reward for completing the full goal

**6. AN ACHIEVABLE TARGET**
- Realistic, achievable, and something everyone can get behind
- Must align with company obligations and available resources
- Must be something participants believe they can actually hit

### Scoreboard Design Requirements
- Must be fun, creative, and visual
- Must enable everyone to see progress being made
- Must be accessible to everyone on the team AND something they cannot help but see every day
- Winning or losing must be determinable with a 3-second (or less) glance
- Physical/tangible scoreboards are preferred over digital

**Real Scoreboard Examples:**
- **Arcade "Whack-a-Mole" Theme:** 3D scoreboard where each "mole" represents a product line; as inventory reduces, the mole goes further down into the hole
- **"Save the Clydesdale" Theme:** A Clydesdale pulling a cart on a trail; weeks are marked incrementally on the path; the horse moves farther from the "glue factory" toward the production plant
- **Pizza Theme ("Pickup or Delivery?"):** Big pizza poster; every week the team hits their goal, an extra slice of pepperoni is added to the pizza

### How MiniGames Connect to Huddles
- MiniGame scoreboard updates are shared in weekly Company-Wide Huddles
- Updates also communicated through emails and team/department meetings
- The Producer reports progress and rallies the team during huddle time

### How to Create a MiniGame (Step-by-Step)
1. Identify a specific weakness or opportunity that aligns with company objectives
2. Give the game a creative name that relates to the goal (this sets the tone for designing the scoreboard)
3. Select a Producer/Champion
4. Define who the players are (everyone who can impact the outcome)
5. Set a specific, measurable target
6. Establish start and end dates (60-90 days recommended)
7. Design the themed scoreboard (must pass the 3-second test)
8. Define progressive reward levels
9. Communicate rules clearly to all participants
10. Track and update progress in weekly huddles
11. Celebrate achievements and recognize contributors at the end

### Real-World Result Example
Anderson Precision's "Lock and Load" MiniGame improved CNC machine utilization, saving approximately $500,000 annually across 15 MiniGames.

## 3. OPEN-BOOK MANAGEMENT APPROACH

### Philosophy
Open-book management goes beyond just sharing financial information with employees -- it is about responsibility, ownership, results, and growth. The proposition: the best, most efficient, most profitable way to operate a business is to give everybody in the company a voice in saying how the company is run and a stake in the outcome.

### Exactly What Financial Numbers Are Shared

**Primary Financial Statements (All Three):**
1. **Income Statement (P&L)** -- The primary scoreboard; every line item is shared and assigned to an owner
2. **Balance Sheet** -- Taught to employees to understand company health, assets, liabilities, equity
3. **Cash Flow Statement** -- Critical for understanding how the business generates and uses cash

**Specific Line Items Shared:**
- Revenue / Sales
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
- Gross Margin / Gross Profit
- Operating Expenses (broken down by department)
- Net Operating Income / Profit
- Capital Expenses
- Assets
- Liabilities
- Equity
- Debt-to-Equity Ratio
- Cash position
- Any other key metrics needed to show how company performance is measured

### How Often
- **Weekly:** All financial scoreboards are updated every week during the Huddle Cycle; forecasts are updated weekly
- **Monthly:** Full month-end financial close reviewed; blank scoreboards distributed; next 3 months projected and reviewed together
- **Quarterly:** Formal review tied to bonus payouts
- **Annually:** Full financial plan/budget created through High-Involvement Planning

### With Whom
- **Every single employee at every level** -- from the shop floor to the C-suite
- New employees begin receiving financial training within their first 180 days

### In What Format
- **The Financial Scoreboard:** A simplified, common-sense version of the income statement (NOT the raw accounting report). It shows the line items of the income statement with forecast for the month, YTD forecast, and YTD actuals.
- **Mural-Sized Wall Charts:** Posted in cafeterias and common areas showing income/expense breakdowns, plant efficiency metrics, and product composition (updated daily at SRC)
- **Digital Screens and Department Dashboards:** In break rooms and on digital displays
- **Game Binders:** Physical binders given to each employee containing annual plan, scoreboards, bonus plan, glossary
- **Individual Blank Scoreboards:** Distributed monthly for employees to track their own numbers

### What Makes GGOB Open-Book Different from Just "Sharing Numbers"
1. Numbers are FORWARD-LOOKING (forecasts), not just historical reports
2. Employees OWN their line items and report their OWN numbers (bottom-up, not top-down)
3. Employees are TAUGHT how to read and understand the financials
4. Employees can AFFECT the numbers they own
5. Employees have a FINANCIAL STAKE tied to the outcomes

## 4. FINANCIAL LITERACY TRAINING INTEGRATION

### The Critical Number

**Definition:** The one operational or financial number that represents a weakness or vulnerability that, if not addressed and corrected, will negatively impact the overall performance and long-term security of the business.

**How to Identify It (8 Evaluation Questions):**
1. Is it critical to the success of the company?
2. Is it reality-based? What business issues support selecting it?
3. How impactful is it on operations?
4. Did the team contribute to selecting it?
5. What happens if we do not address it (consequences of inaction)?
6. Is it a common goal? Who can influence it?
7. Is it reasonably achievable/attainable?
8. What business literacy learning will result from pursuing it?

**Examples of Critical Numbers:** Net Operating Income, Revenue per Employee, Debt-to-Equity Ratio, Gross Margin, Cash Flow, specific operational metrics

**Key Principle:** The Critical Number can change year to year. Stick to 2-3 goals per year, and choose goals that make the company stronger by eliminating weaknesses. Choose goals off the financial statements that require 5-6 things to be done right.

**SRC Historical Example:** When SRC was founded, their debt-to-equity ratio was 89:1. The Critical Number was making bank loan payments. Jack Stack used this shared objective to educate employees about debt through weekly huddles over 52 lessons.

### High-Involvement Planning (HIP)

HIP transforms traditional annual planning by involving, educating, and informing everyone in the company about strategic goals and realities. It is a reality-based, repetitive approach to setting strategy.

**4-Stage Process with Exact Timeline:**

**STAGE 1: BRAINSTORMING (June-August)**
- Participants: ALL company employees
- Leadership team reviews stages, timelines, and expectations during regular meetings
- "No idea is a bad idea" brainstorming phase
- Every team member contributes at least one initiative or goal idea
- Output: Team leads narrow ideas down to top 3 per team by end of August

**STAGE 2: TEAM LEAD PRIORITIZATION (September)**
- Begins early September, completed by September 30
- All team leads share their team's top 3 initiatives and justify importance
- Each idea must answer: (1) Is it strategic and moves toward 3-year and 10-year vision? (2) Is it urgent enough to address?
- Output: Master list distributed to team leads for team feedback
- Budget process begins with year-to-date pace data distributed by October 1

**STAGE 3: MANAGEMENT DELIBERATION (October)**
- Throughout October, completed by October 31
- Series of management meetings (as many as needed, usually no more than 4)
- Discuss, debate, and decide top 1-7 goals for the year
- All team leads submit projected budgets by October 31

**STAGE 4: FINALIZATION (November-December)**
- Final goals distributed to team leads by end of year
- Finance lead consolidates all data by November 30
- Team lead budget review meeting held by November 30
- Budget finalized by December 15
- Goals and financial plan set for upcoming year

### How Financial Literacy Training Integrates into the Weekly Rhythm

**In the Weekly Huddle:**
- Teachable moments at huddles (at minimum twice monthly)
- "Word of the Week" chosen by huddle leaders -- a new financial term explained and discussed
- When employees report their numbers, they must explain what the numbers mean and the "why" behind each metric
- Teams review the scoreboard and explain both positive and negative variances in detail
- "Training Bites" -- brief educational segments embedded in the huddle agenda
- Small games or activities to reinforce financial concepts

**Financial Literacy Flash Cards:**
- Companies develop custom flash cards explaining financial terms with real company-specific examples and questions to confirm learning

**The Dollar Exercise:**
- An in-house class using REAL money to explain what it takes to run a business
- Based on the company's actual percentage of costs
- Shows employees how small the bottom line actually is
- Described as "an eye-opener" for participants

**Structured New Employee Onboarding:**
- Series of financial trainings within first 180 days
- Covers GGOB basics, financial terminology via fun games
- Reinforcement through ongoing huddle discussions

**What Is Taught (Curriculum Topics):**
- Profit and Loss / Income Statements
- Revenue / Sales
- Cost of Goods Sold
- Gross Margin
- Operating Expenses
- Balance Sheet fundamentals
- Assets, Liabilities, Equity
- Cash Flow Statement
- Capital Expenses
- The Critical Number and what drives it
- How to read and interpret variance
- How individual actions affect each line item

**Training Delivery Principles:**
- Keep training casual, entertaining, and fun
- Conduct educational meetings following regular staff meeting or Huddle structure
- Use MiniGames to make content engaging
- Rotate through multiple leaders and trainers
- Embedded finance team members sit in open floor plans, accessible to any employee with questions

## 5. THE FORECASTING SYSTEM

### Core Concept
Every employee learns to predict the company's financials by owning specific line items on the income statement and forecasting where those numbers will end each month, using real-time operational knowledge.

### How Line Items Are Assigned
- Every line item on the income statement is assigned to a specific person -- the "Line-Item Owner"
- Each line item is assigned to the person closest to that number, who most frequently handles that item
- Adding NAME COLUMNS to the traditional P&L statement transforms abstract financials into personal accountability
- Each employee has responsibility for at least one line item
- Frontline employees track, measure, and forecast their assigned metrics

### How the Forecasting Process Works (Week by Week)

**Week 1 of the Month:**
1. Line-item owners review their weekly activity and operational data in their accounts
2. Using their knowledge of customers, vendors, orders, and operations TODAY, each owner develops a forecast for where their line item will end the month
3. During the Pre-Huddle, owners share their forecasts with their department
4. Department forecasts roll up to the Management Huddle
5. At the Company-Wide Huddle, every line-item owner reports their forecast. Numbers are written on the large scoreboard. The P&L is literally built line by line in front of everyone.
6. The team does the calculations together to see the projected bottom line and progress toward bonus goals

**Weeks 2-4 of the Month:**
1. As more information becomes available (orders ship, invoices come in, expenses are incurred), owners update their forecasts
2. Forecasts are adjusted and written on the scoreboard each week
3. All employees can see how the month is progressing toward the bonus goal
4. If a number is up or down from forecast, the "story behind the number" is told -- explaining what happened and what can be done
5. Variances of more than 5% below projection require a rational explanation

**End of Month:**
- Actual results are compared to forecasts
- Accuracy of forecasts is reviewed
- Lessons learned are discussed
- New month's forecasting begins

### The Forecasting Huddle Format
- The entire company comes together (example: Monday at 11 a.m.)
- Every person who owns a line item comes PREPARED to share their forecast
- Each employee reports out on their number
- In essence, the team is BUILDING the P&L every single week
- 80% or more of the effort should be spent looking forward (not backward)

### What Makes This System Work
- Forecasting encourages employees to think about cause and effect -- how they can INFLUENCE the numbers rather than just passively look at results to date
- The system uses real-time data combined with individual knowledge to produce extremely accurate forecasts
- The forecast is an educated best estimate or opinion on what is expected
- Prior-week performance data is recorded and reported (overtime hours, tons produced, sales calls made, etc.)
- Forecasting process is constantly reviewed and altered to meet changing needs

### Confidence Ratings
Employees pair their forecasts with confidence ratings to indicate how certain they are of their predictions, helping management assess risk.

## 6. BONUS / PROFIT-SHARING SYSTEM ("A STAKE IN THE OUTCOME")

### Philosophy
A Stake in the Outcome is an equitable system that connects the people who create the numbers and the results in the business with the rewards and recognition they deserve -- while eliminating entitlement and resentment.

### Structure: GAIN-SHARING (Not Profit-Sharing)

GGOB uses a "Gain Share" model, not a traditional "Profit Share." The bonus pool is completely self-funded by the "gain" over a defined threshold.

### How It Works (Step by Step)

**Step 1: Protect Long-Term Financial Security**
- The company's financial health is priority #1
- A healthy balance sheet means sustainability and job security
- Until the company is secure, no one should earn a bonus

**Step 2: Establish the Threshold**
- Review investments needed for continued growth
- Determine the THRESHOLD: the minimum profit performance required to maintain long-term business security
- The threshold is typically set within industry benchmarks for profitability
- This is the floor -- no bonuses until the company exceeds this number

**Step 3: Calculate the Gain**
- Any profit generated OVER the threshold funds the bonus pool
- The gain = Actual Profit minus Threshold Profit

**Step 4: Split the Gain**
- **50 cents on every dollar of gain goes to the BONUS POOL**
- **50 cents on every dollar of gain goes BACK INTO THE COMPANY** (for unplanned needs, growth investment, reserves)
- The program is designed to be self-funding -- about 90% of the time, improved performance funds the bonuses

**Step 5: Distribute the Bonus Pool**
- Distributed based on compensation level and contribution
- Bonuses paid QUARTERLY (not annually)

### Maximum Bonus Percentages (SRC Holdings Specifics)
- **Hourly and non-exempt workers:** Up to 13% of annual salary
- **Managers:** Up to 18% of annual salary

### Escalating Quarterly Payout Structure
Bonuses are annualized and paid in INCREASING increments throughout the year:
- **Q1:** 10% of the annual bonus potential
- **Q2:** 20% of the annual bonus potential
- **Q3:** 30% of the annual bonus potential
- **Q4:** 40% of the annual bonus potential

**Why Escalating:**
- Prevents paying for results that are not ultimately achieved by year end
- Keeps employees engaged throughout the full year
- The largest bonus is awarded in Q4 to maintain late-year motivation
- If a missed quarter's profit criterion is achieved in a subsequent quarter or by year-end, the full incentive can still be awarded

### How Bonuses Tie to the Huddle System
- Every employee can forecast their bonus take each week after the all-team Huddle
- Weekly huddles show how the company is doing in relation to annual goals and whether quarterly bonuses will be earned
- The scoreboard visually tracks progress toward the bonus threshold
- When quarterly profitability is achieved, each employee is awarded a bonus based on their compensation level
- Quarterly "Game Day" celebrations distribute bonuses and celebrate achievements

### Bonus Target Selection
- Choose a bonus target that everyone can impact
- The target should have clear departmental connections to ensure alignment
- Typically tied to the Critical Number

### How Bonus Priorities Work During Downturns (SRC Order of Operations)
1. Bonuses are cut FIRST
2. ESOP payments follow
3. Salaries reduced THIRD
4. Layoffs considered only as LAST resort

### Seven Building Blocks of an Effective Bonus Plan
1. Ensure company long-term financial security
2. Provide a significant portion of gains to employees
3. Rally the entire organization around a Critical Number
4. Teach business principles so people understand how to influence the bonus
5. Enable early and frequent wins
6. Communicate repeatedly (weekly through huddles)
7. Celebrate wins and recognize contributors

### ESOP (Employee Stock Ownership Plan) -- The Long-Term Wealth Builder
- At SRC, after 3 months of employment, associates are enrolled in the ESOP
- The ESOP is separate from the quarterly bonus program
- Financial results, investments, and property holdings shape the value of each associate's shares
- Every year, a third party updates the business value, driving the stock price of ESOP shares
- SRC has paid out approximately $125 million over 38 years to cash out retiring or departing owners
- Many retirees left as millionaires
- SRC also maintains a separate 401(k) plan, encouraging 10% annual savings as insurance

## 7. THE "LINE OF SIGHT" CONCEPT

### Definition
A clear, unobstructed view from an individual employee's daily actions and decisions directly to the company's most important financial goals. Every employee is given a direct line-of-sight to how their attitude, actions, and behavior impact the company's financials both negatively and positively.

### How It Is Created

**1. Identify the Critical Number**
- The company's primary weakness or opportunity

**2. Identify the Drivers**
- Drivers are the specific strategies that can be acted on to directly affect the Critical Number
- Each department identifies its own drivers

**Real-World Department Driver Examples:**
- **Production:** Packaging errors per 1,000 units, shop efficiencies
- **Logistics/Shipping:** Shipping cost per kilogram
- **Sales:** Average wholesale order size, revenue targets
- **Customer Service:** Repeat order rate
- **Materials:** Inventory management, better buying
- **Finance:** Controlled capital spending

**3. Assign Line-Item Ownership**
- Every employee owns at least one line item on the income statement
- They track, forecast, and report their own numbers
- They understand how their line item affects the bottom line

**4. Connect Through the Scoreboard**
- Individual metrics roll up to department scorecards
- Department scorecards roll up to the company-wide financial scoreboard
- Every employee can trace: "My actions --> My line item --> Department scorecard --> Company P&L --> Bonus payout"

**5. Reinforce Through Huddles**
- Weekly forecasting discussions make the connection visible and personal
- Employees explain variances -- which reinforces cause-and-effect understanding
- The bonus system provides tangible financial motivation

### Key Principle
The framework recognizes that employees cannot hit a target they cannot see. Rather than cascading metrics top-down, organizations should give employees the education to align themselves to the most important goals. Employees who set their own goals tend to achieve them.

## 10. HOW SRC HOLDINGS ACTUALLY RUNS THEIR WEEKLY RHYTHM

### Company Background
- Founded 1983 as a leveraged buyout from International Harvester
- Started with $100,000 in equity, $16M revenue, debt-to-equity of 89:1
- Now: 100% employee-owned (ESOP), multiple subsidiary companies
- Revenue grew from $16M (1983) to $83M (1992) to over $600M+ today
- Paid out approximately $125 million to departing/retiring employee-owners over 38 years

### SRC's Actual Weekly Operations

**Physical Environment:**
- Mural-sized wall charts posted in cafeterias showing income/expense breakdowns, plant efficiency metrics, and product composition
- Charts are updated DAILY, enabling staff to detect variances immediately
- Scoreboards are hung on display and always visible -- on walls, TV screens, in break rooms
- The CFO and finance team sit in the open floor plan, available to any employee with questions

**The Weekly Rhythm at SRC:**
1. **Daily Pre-Huddles** across all departments -- each workgroup reviews their operational numbers and prepares their forecasts (7-15 min)
2. **Weekly Management Huddle** -- department leaders compile data, review Critical Numbers, address variances (15-30 min)
3. **Weekly "Great Huddle"** (Company-Wide Staff Meeting) -- all employees gather; line-item owners build the P&L live on the scoreboard; forecasts are written up; stories behind numbers are shared; financial literacy moments delivered; MiniGame updates shared; celebrations conducted (30-45 min)
4. **Post-Huddles** -- departments break out to connect company numbers to their specific work

**Forecasting Discipline:**
- Every employee who owns a line item comes prepared to share what their forecast is for how the month will end
- When actual results deviate more than 5% below projections, the responsible party must provide a rational explanation
- Managers and employees treat financial projections as binding promises

**Financial Training at SRC:**
- Jack Stack originally taught managers and supervisors how to read the financials
- They, in turn, gave an abbreviated course to hourly employees
- Used 52 weekly huddles to teach employees about debt and financial literacy
- Systematic teaching of non-executive personnel on how business decisions impact performance
- Emphasis on correct margin calculations and accounting fundamentals

**The Huddle Is the Heartbeat:**
Jack Stack: "When we come out of the Huddle, we can see the whole field before us. We know who is where, how the game is unfolding, and what each of us has to do to make sure we keep moving closer to the goal line."

## 11. COMMON IMPLEMENTATION FAILURES AND TIMELINE TO RESULTS

### The 4 Most Common Mistakes

**MISTAKE 1: REPORTING VS. MANAGING**
- Sharing past financial reports without forward forecasting
- Just distributing last month's income statement is not open-book management
- The power comes from using LIVING financial statements to forecast and change results that have not yet occurred
- Historical reporting provides no actionable value for employee decision-making

**MISTAKE 2: INSUFFICIENT FINANCIAL EDUCATION**
- Distributing financial data without ensuring employees understand it
- Employees may grasp their individual impact but lack comprehensive understanding
- Even educated employees often feel uncomfortable with basic accounting
- Must provide business and financial literacy training at ALL organizational levels

**MISTAKE 3: INCONSISTENT COMMUNICATION**
- Starting to share information then becoming sporadic
- If you are not consistently communicating, employees lose interest or assume you have something to hide
- The system requires disciplined weekly huddles without exception
- "People can fall off the wagon in a single week"

**MISTAKE 4: PASSIVE VS. ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT**
- Sharing numbers without inviting employee input (one-directional)
- Real management happens when employees share the numbers with YOU
- Employees must track their own metrics and suggest improvements
- Without active engagement, the system becomes "just another meeting"

### Additional Failure Patterns

- **"Fair-weather Great Gamers"** -- Leaders who have passion and intent but miss the mark in one or more areas
- **Lack of External Accountability** -- Without an experienced practitioner giving feedback and accountability, progress gets dragged out beyond timetables or falls flat
- **Not Involving All Levels** -- The system works only when applied as a full team effort at every level of the organization
- **Treating Huddles as Optional** -- Allowing people to skip or deprioritize huddles kills the rhythm
- **Not Closing the Loop on the Bonus** -- If employees cannot see the direct connection between their work and their bonus, motivation dies

### Timeline to Results

**With a Dedicated GGOB Coach:**
- Implementation takes approximately 90 days
- Includes 3-4 days on-site plus weekly coaching conference calls
- Results begin appearing within the first quarter

**With the 8-Week Implementation Course:**
- Hybrid learning model: theory + practice + coached implementation + community
- Approximately 120 days (the "Get in the Game" Implementation Course)

**Self-Implementation (Reading the Book Only):**
- Longer lead times to implementation and seeing results
- Can become more expensive on the back-end without guidance
- Higher risk of implementation failure

### Documented Results from Companies

**First-Year Results (Various Companies):**
- **Experity (Healthcare):** Revenue increased 15.8%, EBITDA increased 174% in first 6 months
- **Medical Practice:** Collections increased 1%, profitability increased 47% in year 1
- **English Tea Shop:** 31% improvement in productivity within first 12 months, with no new investments in systems or technology
- **Texas Air Composites:** Profit went from $55K/3.6% of sales (2001) to $1.3M/12.4% of sales (2004)

**Long-Term Results:**
- **SRC Holdings (Founder):** Revenue $16M to $83M (1983-1992); company value $100,000 to $25M in same period; now valued at $600M+
- **SRC Employee Wealth:** $125 million paid out to retiring/departing employee-owners over 38 years; multiple employees retired as millionaires

### The 10-Step Implementation Sequence

1. **Begin with the Right Leadership** -- Identify leadership qualities that make or break implementation
2. **Share the Why Before the How** -- Build awareness, commitment, and desire to participate
3. **Open the Books** -- Establish financial transparency; teach employees to understand the numbers using the Dollar Exercise
4. **Focus on the Critical Number** -- Define the organization's primary performance metric using the 8-question evaluation
5. **Act on the Right Drivers** -- Create line-of-sight between daily work and financial impact using visuals, cheat sheets, flowcharts
6. **Create an Early Win with MiniGames** -- Launch first 90-day MiniGame to build momentum and quick wins
7. **Provide a Stake in the Outcome** -- Design the gain-share bonus plan with threshold, 50/50 split, escalating quarterly payouts
8. **Keep Score** -- Build compelling, relevant, highly-visible scoreboards; assign line-item ownership
9. **Follow the Action** -- Establish the Huddle rhythm: daily Pre-Huddles, weekly Management Huddles, weekly Company-Wide Huddles, Post-Huddles
10. **Apply High-Involvement Planning** -- Implement the 4-stage annual planning process with company-wide participation

## APPENDIX: JACK STACK'S HIGHER LAWS OF BUSINESS

1. **You Get What You Give** -- Reward employees proportionally to effort
2. **It's Easy to Stop One Guy, But It's Pretty Hard to Stop 100** -- The power of teamwork and collective ownership
3. **What Goes Around Comes Around** -- Impact awareness and treating people fairly
4. **You Do What You Gotta Do** -- Creative problem-solving mindset; never give up
5. **You Gotta Wanna** -- Voluntary motivation through stake alignment; you cannot force engagement
6. **You Can Sometimes Fool the Fans, But You Can Never Fool the Players** -- Internal honesty and transparency are non-negotiable
7. **When You Raise the Bottom, the Top Rises** -- Value every role; invest in the lowest performers
8. **When People Set Their Own Targets, They Usually Hit Them** -- Employee goal-setting drives achievement
9. **If Nobody Pays Attention, People Stop Caring** -- Recognition and consistent communication matter
