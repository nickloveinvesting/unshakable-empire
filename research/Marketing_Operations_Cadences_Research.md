### EXACT AGENDA (60 MINUTES)

#### 0:00-0:05 -- WINS & GOOD NEWS (5 min)

- Each person shares one marketing win from the past week
- Examples: "Best performing ad ever at $12 CPA," "Landed a customer from SEO blog post," "Email open rate hit 48%"
- Purpose: Builds momentum, reinforces what is working

**Rule:** Maximum 1 minute per person. No problem-solving here.

#### 0:05-0:20 -- SCORECARD REVIEW (15 min)

Review the weekly Marketing Scorecard (see Section 4 below). For each metric:

1. Read the number out loud
2. Compare to the weekly goal
3. Mark as GREEN (on/above target), YELLOW (within 10%), or RED (>10% below target)
4. Do NOT problem-solve RED items here -- just note them

**RAG (Red/Amber/Green) Threshold Protocol:**
- **GREEN:** Within 5% of target or above
- **YELLOW (Amber):** 5-15% below target
- **RED:** >15% below target OR trending down 3+ consecutive weeks

**EOS Scorecard Format (Gino Wickman - Traction):**
- Rows: 5-15 measurables
- Columns: Owner | Goal | Week 1 | Week 2 | ... | Week 13 (rolling 13-week view)
- Each cell: Actual number + on-track/off-track indicator

#### 0:20-0:35 -- CHANNEL DEEP DIVE (15 min)

Rotate one channel per week on a 4-week cycle:

| Week | Channel Focus | Key Questions to Answer |
|------|--------------|------------------------|
| Week 1 | Paid Search (Google) | Which keywords converting? CPA by campaign? Search term waste? |
| Week 2 | Paid Social (Meta/Facebook) | Which audiences performing? Creative fatigue? Funnel drop-off? |
| Week 3 | Email & Nurture | List health? Automation performance? Revenue per email? |
| Week 4 | SEO & Content | Ranking changes? Organic conversion rate? Content gaps? |

**For each deep dive, review:**
1. Week-over-week performance (this week vs. last week)
2. Month-to-date vs. monthly target pacing
3. Top 3 performing assets/campaigns (what's working)
4. Bottom 3 performing assets/campaigns (what to fix or kill)
5. One specific test or optimization to run next week

#### 0:35-0:45 -- ISSUES LIST (10 min)

**IDS Process (from EOS - Entrepreneurial Operating System):**
1. **Identify** -- List all issues/blockers surfaced during scorecard and deep dive
2. **Discuss** -- Pick the #1 most important issue; discuss root cause (not symptoms)
3. **Solve** -- Agree on a specific action, owner, and deadline

**Common issues to address:**
- Lead quality complaints from sales
- Budget pacing (over/under spending)
- Creative/content bottlenecks
- Technical issues (tracking, landing pages, forms)
- Competitor activity changes

**Rule:** Only solve 1-3 issues per meeting. The rest go on next week's list.

#### 0:45-0:55 -- UPCOMING WEEK PLAN (10 min)

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Campaigns launching | List new campaigns/ads going live |
| Content publishing | Blog posts, emails, social content scheduled |
| Tests starting | A/B tests, new audiences, new offers |
| Budget adjustments | Any mid-week budget shifts needed |
| Deadlines | Assets needed, approvals required |

#### 0:55-1:00 -- ACTION ITEMS & CASCADING MESSAGES (5 min)

- Each person states their #1 to-do for the week (related to marketing)
- Assign owners and deadlines for every action item
- Decide what (if anything) needs to be communicated to rest of company
- Rate the meeting 1-10 (keeps meeting quality high over time)

---

### DECISIONS THAT GET MADE IN WEEKLY MEETINGS

1. **Kill or Scale Decisions:** Pause underperforming campaigns (>20% above CPA target for 2+ weeks) or increase budget on winners
2. **Creative Rotation:** Approve new ad creative; retire fatigued ads (frequency >3)
3. **Budget Reallocation:** Shift up to 10-15% of weekly budget between channels based on performance
4. **Test Priorities:** Decide which A/B test to run next
5. **Content Calendar Adjustments:** Move or add content based on what's trending/working
6. **Lead Quality Actions:** Adjust targeting, add negative keywords, or change qualification criteria

### THE 5 CEO NUMBERS (Explained)

These are the only 5 metrics a CEO needs. Based on HubSpot's research and DashThis best practices:

| # | Metric | What It Answers | Why CEOs Care |
|---|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1 | **Marketing-Sourced Revenue** | "Is marketing making us money?" | Directly ties marketing to the P&L |
| 2 | **New Customers Acquired** | "How many new customers did marketing bring?" | Growth velocity indicator |
| 3 | **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** | "How much does it cost to get a customer?" | Unit economics; profitability check |
| 4 | **Marketing ROI / ROAS** | "For every $1 we spend, how much do we get back?" | Efficiency of marketing investment |
| 5 | **Pipeline Value** | "What's the future revenue marketing is building?" | Forward-looking; predicts next month |

---

### DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR THE 60-SECOND DASHBOARD

Based on research from BrightEdge, Improvado, and Geckoboard:

1. **Maximum 5 hero metrics** displayed as large numbers with trend arrows
2. **RAG color coding** on every metric (green/yellow/red)
3. **Comparison context** on every number: vs. last month, vs. goal, % change
4. **One trend chart** showing 3-6 months of the primary revenue metric
5. **One allocation chart** showing where budget is going (pie or bar)
6. **No jargon:** Use "Cost to Get a Customer" not "CAC" if CEO is non-marketing
7. **Update frequency:** Weekly (minimum); daily is ideal for $10K+/month budgets
8. **Group similar data:** Revenue metrics together, efficiency metrics together

**CEO Dashboard Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Include):**
- Impressions without context
- Click counts without conversion data
- Social follower counts
- Raw traffic numbers without conversion rates
- Any metric without a target/goal comparison

# 6. VANITY METRICS VS ACTIONABLE METRICS BY CHANNEL

## Framework: The Vanity/Actionable Metric Matrix

**Source Frameworks:**
- Ruler Analytics Vanity vs. Actionable Framework
- AgencyAnalytics Actionable Insights Guide
- HubSpot Vanity Metrics Guide
- Tableau Vanity Metrics Definition
- Ahrefs SEO Metrics That Matter

**Core Principle:** A vanity metric makes you FEEL good. An actionable metric helps you DECIDE what to do next. If a metric doesn't change your behavior when it goes up or down, it's vanity.

---

### CHANNEL: FACEBOOK / META ADS

| Vanity Metric | Why It's Vanity | Actionable Alternative | Why It's Actionable | Benchmark |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Page Likes** | Doesn't correlate with revenue; can be bought | **Cost Per Lead (CPL)** | Directly measures acquisition efficiency | Avg: $27.66 (2025) |
| **Post Reach** | Algorithmic; doesn't mean people cared | **Cost Per Result** | Measures what you actually pay per desired outcome | Varies by industry |
| **Impressions** | Just means it appeared; no engagement proof | **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)** | Directly measures revenue vs. spend | Target: >3x |
| **Likes / Reactions** | Engagement theater; doesn't drive sales | **Conversion Rate** | Measures actual business outcomes | Avg: 2-14% by industry |
| **Video Views (3-second)** | Auto-play inflates; minimal attention | **ThruPlay Rate + Cost Per ThruPlay** | Measures genuine video attention | Target: >15% ThruPlay |
| **CTR (alone)** | High clicks with no conversions = wasted money | **CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)** | Measures actual customer cost | Avg: $19.68 (2025) |
| **Follower Count** | Organic reach is <5%; followers != customers | **Email Signups from Social** | Captures to owned channel | Track weekly |

---

### CHANNEL: GOOGLE ADS

| Vanity Metric | Why It's Vanity | Actionable Alternative | Why It's Actionable | Benchmark |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Impressions** | Means nothing without action | **Impression Share** | Shows market capture vs. opportunity | Target: >60% brand, >30% non-brand |
| **Clicks** | Traffic without conversion = cost | **Conversions** | Actual business outcomes | Avg CVR: 7.52% (2025) |
| **CTR (alone)** | Can be gamed with broad match / clickbait | **Conversion Rate** | Measures if clicks become customers | Avg: 7.52% (2025) |
| **Average CPC** | Low CPC with no conversions is still waste | **Cost Per Conversion / CPA** | Actual cost to acquire outcome | Varies: $1-$131 by industry |
| **Total Spend** | Spending more != doing better | **ROAS or Cost Per Acquisition** | Efficiency of every dollar | Target: >3x ROAS |
| **Search Impression Share** | Useful alone but misleading without quality | **Quality Score + Conversion Rate** | Measures relevance AND results | QS target: 7+ |

---

### CHANNEL: EMAIL MARKETING

| Vanity Metric | Why It's Vanity | Actionable Alternative | Why It's Actionable | Benchmark |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| **List Size** | Big list with low engagement = deliverability risk | **Engaged Subscriber %** | Measures active, reachable audience | Target: >30% opened in 90 days |
| **Open Rate** | Apple MPP inflates; not reliable since iOS 15 | **Click-to-Open Rate (CTOR)** | Measures content relevance for those who opened | Avg: 6.81% (2025); Target: 10-15% |
| **Emails Sent** | Volume != effectiveness | **Revenue Per Email Sent** | Direct financial impact | Track trend; automated flows 30x higher |
| **Open Rate (alone)** | Privacy changes make it unreliable | **Click-Through Rate** | Measures actual engagement action | Avg: 2.09% (2025) |
| **Unsubscribe Rate (alone)** | Low unsub can mean people just ignore you | **List Health Score** (engagement + deliverability) | Holistic list quality measure | Unsub <0.5%; bounce <2% |
| **Total Clicks** | Raw number without context | **Conversion Rate from Email** | Measures business outcome | Track per campaign |

---

### CHANNEL: SEO / ORGANIC SEARCH

| Vanity Metric | Why It's Vanity | Actionable Alternative | Why It's Actionable | Benchmark |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Total Pageviews** | Traffic without purpose = meaningless | **Organic Conversion Rate** | Measures if organic traffic converts | Target: 2-5% |
| **Keyword Rankings (alone)** | #1 for irrelevant keyword = no value | **Organic Revenue / Organic Leads** | Business outcomes from organic | Track monthly |
| **Domain Authority** | Proprietary metric; not used by Google | **Referring Domains (quality)** | Actual link building progress | Track monthly growth |
| **Total Organic Sessions** | Without conversion context, it's vanity | **Organic Sessions to Target Pages** | Traffic to pages that matter | Track weekly |
| **Bounce Rate (alone)** | Blog posts naturally have high bounce | **Engaged Sessions (GA4)** | Measures meaningful interaction | Target: >60% engaged |
| **Total Indexed Pages** | More pages != better if quality is low | **Pages Driving Conversions** | Focus on pages that produce results | Track top 20 |
| **Time on Page (alone)** | Can mean confused, not engaged | **Goal Completions from Organic** | Direct business outcome | Track weekly |

---

### CHANNEL: SOCIAL MEDIA (ORGANIC)

|---------------|----------------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Follower Count** | Followers don't pay bills | **Social-Referred Conversions** | Actual business impact | Track in GA4 |
| **Likes** | Lowest effort engagement; algorithm-boosted | **Saves + Shares** | Indicates genuine value to audience | Track ratio to impressions |
| **Reach** | Algorithmic; doesn't mean engagement | **Engagement Rate** | Measures audience interaction quality | FB: 1-3%; IG: 3-6% |
| **Impressions** | Counted per view, not per person | **Link Clicks (to website)** | Drives traffic to owned property | Track weekly |
| **Video Views** | Auto-play inflated | **Watch Time + Completion Rate** | Measures genuine content consumption | Target: >50% completion |

---

### UNIVERSAL DECISION FRAMEWORK

**The "So What?" Test for Any Metric:**

Ask these 3 questions about any metric you're tracking:

1. **"If this number goes up, what specific action would I take?"** -- If no answer, it's vanity.
2. **"If this number goes down, what specific action would I take?"** -- If no answer, it's vanity.
3. **"Does this metric connect to revenue within 2 steps?"** -- If no, it's probably vanity.

**The Metric Hierarchy (Most to Least Actionable):**

```
TIER 1 (Track Daily):     Revenue, CAC, ROAS, CPA, Conversions
TIER 2 (Track Weekly):    CPL, CVR, Email CTR, Organic Leads, Pipeline
TIER 3 (Track Monthly):   Traffic, Rankings, List Size, Follower Growth
TIER 4 (Ignore/Context):  Impressions, Reach, Likes, Pageviews, Open Rate
```
