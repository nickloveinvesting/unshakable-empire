# FOUNDATIONAL PREMISE

The real enemy of execution is not incompetence, laziness, or lack of strategy. It is the **whirlwind** -- the massive amount of energy required just to keep your operation going on a day-to-day basis. The 4 Disciplines of Execution is not about how to tame the whirlwind; it is about how to achieve your most critical goals **in spite of** the whirlwind.

**The core allocation rule:** 80% of your team's time and energy stays with the whirlwind (day-to-day operations). 20% is protected and committed to the WIG. The 4DX framework governs that 20%.

# DISCIPLINE 1: FOCUS ON THE WILDLY IMPORTANT GOAL (WIG)
<a name="discipline-1"></a>

## The Core Principle

"The more goals you pursue, the fewer you achieve." The human mind can only devote its best efforts to one thing at a time. Organizations that try to execute 5, 10, or 20 important goals simultaneously end up executing none of them well.

## The WIG Limit Rule

| Level | Maximum WIGs |
|-------|-------------|
| Organizational (top-level) | 1-2 WIGs, 3 at absolute maximum |
| Team level | No more than 2 WIGs per team |
| Individual | Should trace to team WIG |

**Critical rule:** No team focuses on more than 2 WIGs at the same time. This is non-negotiable. If everything is important, nothing is important.

## The Exact WIG Format

Every WIG must contain a clearly measurable result and the date by which that result must be achieved, expressed as:

```
FROM [X] TO [Y] BY [WHEN]
```

- **X** = Current state / baseline measurement
- **Y** = Target state / desired measurement
- **When** = Specific deadline

### WIG Format Rules

1. **Begin with a verb** (increase, reduce, improve, grow, decrease, achieve)
2. **Define the lag measure** as "X to Y by [date]"
3. **Keep it simple** -- focus on the WHAT, not the HOW
4. **Must be measurable** with a clear numeric finish line
5. **Must have a deadline** -- time-bound is non-negotiable

### WIG Examples

| Function | WIG Statement |
|----------|--------------|
| Revenue | "Increase revenue from corporate events from $12M to $18M by December 31" |
| Customer Satisfaction | "Improve client satisfaction from 55% to 80% within 2 years" |
| Manufacturing | "Increase production from 45 to 50 million gallons annually by Q4" |
| Sales | "Grow quarterly revenue by 30% from $2M to $2.6M within 6 months" |
| HR | "Reduce employee turnover from 28% to 15% by end of fiscal year" |
| Cost | "Reduce operational costs from $4.2M to $3.5M by June 30" |

## The Four-Step WIG Selection Process

### Step 1: BRAINSTORM
- Identify all possible changes with the highest organizational impact
- Involve peer leaders and team members
- Ask: "What hasn't been tried? What strengths can we leverage? What obstacles exist?"

### Step 2: APPRAISE
- Evaluate which brainstormed goals would most significantly advance organizational objectives
- Rank by strategic impact

### Step 3: CHECK
- Verify the goal is reasonable and achievable
- Confirm it is measurable
- Confirm it is team-driven (not dependent on outside forces)
- Confirm it is not overly dependent (>20%) on other teams
- Confirm it is supportable with existing resources

### Step 4: WRITE
- Document using the exact "From X to Y by When" format
- Verify it passes the clarity test: could a stranger understand it?

## The Four Rules for Team WIG Selection

1. **Quantity Limit:** No team may choose more than two WIGs
2. **Alignment Requirement:** Team WIGs must directly support the overall organizational WIG
3. **Autonomy Principle:** Teams choose their own WIGs. Senior leaders can VETO but CANNOT DICTATE the team's goal.
4. **Format Specification:** All WIGs must include an end point expressed as "From (current) to (desired) by (deadline)"

# DISCIPLINE 2: ACT ON LEAD MEASURES
<a name="discipline-2"></a>

## The Core Distinction: Lead vs. Lag Measures

### Lag Measures (Outcome Measures)

| Characteristic | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Definition | Results you are trying to achieve -- the WIG itself |
| Timing | Measured AFTER the fact; historical data |
| Control | Cannot be directly influenced once measured |
| Examples | Revenue, profit, market share, customer satisfaction scores, employee turnover rate, website visits |
| Problem | By the time you get the data, you can't change it |

### Lead Measures (Predictive Activity Measures)

| Characteristic | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Definition | Critical activities that are required to drive the lag numbers |
| Timing | Measured in real time or near-real-time (daily/weekly) |
| Control | Directly influenceable by the team (80%+ team control) |
| Examples | Number of customer follow-up calls, training hours completed, preventive maintenance checks |
| Power | Predictive AND influenceable -- the leverage point |

**The key insight:** There MUST be a cause-and-effect relationship between lead and lag measures. If you move the lead measure, the lag measure moves as a consequence.

**Analogy:** If losing 10 pounds is the lag measure (WIG), then running X miles per day and limiting calorie intake to Y calories are the lead measures. You can't directly control the weight on the scale, but you can absolutely control how far you run and what you eat.

## Two Types of Lead Measures

### Type 1: Small Outcomes
- Results-focused measures where teams achieve targets through flexible methods
- The WHAT to achieve, not the HOW
- Example: "Achieve average customer satisfaction scores of 80% each week"
- Advantage: Allows creative problem-solving; team chooses method

### Type 2: Leveraged Behaviors
- Specific behavioral patterns to track -- exact actions prescribed
- Example: "Each team member must help at least 50 customers per week"
- Example: "Upsell the all-inclusive package to four vacationers per week per team member"
- Advantage: Clear, repeatable, easy to track
- Risk: Can become engagement-killing if too repetitive without variation

## Number of Lead Measures Per WIG

The framework recommends **narrowing focus to a few lead measures per WIG** -- typically 2-3. No more than 6 lead or lag measures tracked on the scoreboard per WIG. The key is focus and leverage, not comprehensive coverage.

## Four-Step Lead Measure Selection Process

### Step 1: BRAINSTORM POSSIBILITIES
- Come up with as many ideas as possible
- Consider what activities haven't been tried
- Identify existing strengths to leverage
- Consider potential obstacles
- Apply the 80/20 rule: which 20% of activities drive 80% of results?

### Step 2: ASSESS IMPACT
- Evaluate which measures will most significantly influence the WIG
- Pick just a couple -- not everything
- Rank by impact to narrow focus

### Step 3: TEST CANDIDATES
Each candidate lead measure must pass these criteria:

| Criterion | Test Question |
|-----------|--------------|
| Predictive | "Will this lead measure influence the lag measure / WIG?" |
| Influenceable | "Can our team directly control this without external dependencies?" |
| Maintainable | "Can this be sustained as an ongoing process, not a one-time activity?" |
| Team-driven | "Are the results driven by the team rather than the leader alone?" |
| Measurable | "Can we track this with clear, numeric metrics?" |
| Worth measuring | "Is the effort to track this justified by the impact?" |

### Step 4: WRITE THE FINAL FORM
- Specify whether tracking is individual or team-based
- Establish frequency (daily or weekly minimum)
- Define numerical targets
- Include quality components when applicable
- Use clear language beginning with action verbs

**Example final form:** "Upsell the all-inclusive package to 4 vacationers per week per team member"

## Lead Measure Selection: Identifying the Leverage Point

The critical principle is finding the **bottleneck** -- the specific point in your process where performance is failing.

**Case study (Water Bottling Plant):**
- WIG (lag measure): Increase production from 45 to 50 million gallons annually
- Initial (wrong) approach: Track daily/monthly production totals (these are still lag measures)
- Identified bottleneck: Machine downtime was the constraint
- Selected lead measure: Complete preventive maintenance on each machine weekly
- Result: By focusing efforts on the bottleneck rather than broadly across the whole operation, they achieved the WIG

# DISCIPLINE 3: KEEP A COMPELLING SCOREBOARD
<a name="discipline-3"></a>

## The Core Principle

"People perform best when they are emotionally engaged, and the highest level of engagement comes when people know whether they are winning or losing." People play differently when they are keeping score.

## Player's Scoreboard vs. Coach's Scoreboard

This is one of the most critical distinctions in 4DX:

### Coach's Scoreboard (WRONG for 4DX)
- Complex spreadsheets with extensive data
- Historical trends and detailed analysis
- Only leaders/managers can interpret it
- Leaders maintain the updates
- Contains year-over-year comparisons, projections, variance reports
- Designed for management decision-making

### Player's Scoreboard (CORRECT for 4DX)
- Simple, visual graphs showing only essential information
- Employees UPDATE and MAINTAIN it themselves
- Anyone can understand it in seconds
- Designed for team engagement and accountability
- Shows only: where you are and where you need to be
- Functions like a sports scoreboard, not an analyst dashboard

**The football analogy:** In a football game, there are usually just six distinct pieces of data displayed: score, time, quarter, down, distance, and timeouts. Coaches need far more data to manage the game, but the scoreboard on the field shows only the data needed to PLAY the game.

## The Four Required Characteristics of a Compelling Scoreboard

### Characteristic 1: SIMPLICITY
- Minimal information only -- score, targets, current status
- Excludes reports, historical comparisons, and extraneous data
- Must be easy to update even during the busiest periods
- If it's too complex to keep current, it will be abandoned

### Characteristic 2: VISIBILITY
- Positioned prominently where the team sees it constantly without extra effort
- Physical placement in high-traffic areas (break room, team area, lobby)
- Digital placement for remote teams (shared dashboard, TV monitor)
- Public display increases accountability and inter-team competition
- "The scoreboard at a football game is huge and the numbers gigantic so everyone can tell at a glance who's winning"

### Characteristic 3: COMPLETENESS
- Displays BOTH the WIG (lag measure) AND lead measures
- Shows current position AND target values
- Must include target lines (even estimated ones) to determine winning status
- Can incorporate legends, labels, and numerical differences for clarity

### Characteristic 4: QUICK READABILITY (The 5-Second Test)
- **Anyone looking at the scoreboard can determine in 5 seconds or less whether the team is winning or losing**
- If you can't tell in 5 seconds, it fails
- Uses visual indicators like color coding (red/green/yellow) to show current standing against targets
- This is the ultimate pass/fail test for scoreboard design

## Recommended Chart Types by Measure Type

| Chart Type | Best For | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Trend Lines | Lag measures | Show where you're supposed to be vs. where you are. Above the line = losing; below = winning (for cost) or vice versa |
| Bar Charts | Comparing individuals/teams | Side-by-side performance comparison; effective for lead measure tracking by person |
| Andon Charts | Lead measures | Use symbols (smiley/sad faces, green/red dots) to represent status at a glance |
| Common Gauges | Time-based metrics | Speedometers, thermometers -- useful for process speed or completion metrics |

## Scoreboard Physical Format

The format does not matter as long as it meets all four criteria:
- Poster board
- Whiteboard
- Digital dashboard
- TV monitor
- Excel/Google Sheets projected
- Dedicated software (my4dx.com, Perdoo, etc.)

**Personalization matters:** Let team members personalize the scoreboard (photos, team symbols, custom design elements). This drives ownership and makes winning about personal pride. Engineers might add flashing lights. Sales teams might add photos.

## Who Updates the Scoreboard?

**THE PLAYERS (EMPLOYEES) UPDATE IT. NOT THE LEADER.**

This is critical. When employees update their own scoreboard:
- They take psychological ownership of the numbers
- They can't hide from their performance
- They feel agency over the process
- Updating becomes a commitment ritual

**Frequency:** Updated AT LEAST weekly, ideally more often. If updates lapse, the whirlwind reclaims attention.

# DISCIPLINE 4: CREATE A CADENCE OF ACCOUNTABILITY
<a name="discipline-4"></a>

## The Core Principle

"Accountability means making personal commitments necessary to move the entire team's score forward." The cadence of accountability is the mechanism that transforms strategy from a plan on paper into living, breathing execution.

When individuals commit to fellow team members (not just to the boss), the commitment goes beyond professional job performance to become a personal promise. This peer accountability is more powerful than hierarchical accountability.

## The WIG Session: Definition

A WIG session is a regularly scheduled, highly structured meeting dedicated EXCLUSIVELY to the Wildly Important Goal. It is the heartbeat of the 4DX operating system.

### WIG Session Parameters

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|
| Duration | 20-30 minutes maximum; never longer |
| Frequency | At least weekly; same day, same time, every week |
| Attendance | ALL team members; mandatory, no exceptions |
| Agenda | Fixed 3-part structure; never deviate |
| Whirlwind | NEVER discussed in a WIG session; separate meeting required |
| Sanctity | "Must be considered sacred" -- never cancel, never skip |
| Backup | If leader cannot attend, a trained deputy runs the session with debriefing afterward |

### The Two Unbreakable Rules of WIG Sessions

**Rule 1: CONSISTENCY** -- The WIG session must be held on the same day and at the same time every week. Never miss it. Your team will treat it with exactly as much importance as you do.

**Rule 2: FOCUS PROTECTION** -- The whirlwind is NEVER allowed into a WIG session. Only scoreboard-moving actions and results are discussed. All operational issues require a separate staff meeting.

# THE WEEKLY WIG SESSION -- MINUTE-BY-MINUTE FORMAT
<a name="wig-session"></a>

## The Three-Part Agenda

The WIG session follows exactly three steps, in this order, every single week:

### PART 1: ACCOUNT (Report on Last Week's Commitments)
**Approximate time: 1-2 minutes per person**

Each team member stands and reports:
1. What they committed to doing last week (the specific commitment)
2. Whether they completed it (yes/no -- no ambiguity)
3. What they learned or what happened as a result
4. If incomplete, what happened and what remains

**Format per person:**
```
"Last week I committed to [specific action].
I [did / did not] complete it.
[Result / what I learned / what blocked me]."
```

**Example:**
"Last week I committed to call three key customers about the premium upgrade. I completed all three calls. Two were interested and I have follow-up meetings scheduled. One declined but gave useful feedback about pricing."

**Example:**
"Last week I committed to order new braces for the scaffolding so that conditions for all my crews were up to code. I completed that."

**Rules for Part 1:**
- No justifications or lengthy explanations for missed commitments
- Keep reports factual and brief
- The leader reports FIRST on their own commitments (models accountability)
- Failed commitments from two consecutive weeks should be replaced with different commitments

### PART 2: REVIEW THE SCOREBOARD
**Approximate time: 3-5 minutes total**

The team looks at the scoreboard together and evaluates:
1. Are the lead measures moving? (Are we doing the right activities?)
2. Are the lead measures moving the lag measure? (Is it working?)
3. What's working well? (Celebrate and replicate)
4. What's not working? (Identify and adjust)
5. Any patterns or insights?

**Key questions during review:**
- "Are we winning or losing?"
- "Which lead measures are moving and which are stalled?"
- "What did the person with the best results do differently?"

**Actions during review:**
- Celebrate wins publicly -- recognize superior performance
- Share what works so others can replicate
- Identify who needs help (not to shame, but to support)

### PART 3: PLAN / COMMIT (Make New Commitments for This Week)
**Approximate time: 1-2 minutes per person**

Each team member answers the central question:

> **"What are the one or two most important things I can do THIS WEEK that will have the biggest impact on the scoreboard?"**

Each person makes a specific, measurable commitment:
1. Must be a specific deliverable (not "focus on" or "try to")
2. Must directly influence a lead measure
3. Must be completable within one week
4. Must be within the person's power to carry out

**Format per person:**
```
"This week I commit to [specific, measurable action]
which will impact [lead measure name]."
```

**Example:**
"This week I commit to meeting with the supervisors of crews 9, 11, and 13, reviewing their safety records, and ensuring they have enough safety glasses for everyone."

**Example:**
"This week I commit to sending proposals to five qualified leads from last month's pipeline."

**"Clear the Path" commitments:**
Some commitments may be to help other team members with problems that surfaced during Part 1. Example: "This week I'll research the pricing objection that Sarah's customer raised and come back next week with at least three alternative pricing structures."

## Complete WIG Session Timeline (for a team of 8)

| Time | Activity | Who |
|------|----------|-----|
| 0:00-0:02 | Leader opens, reports on own commitments | Leader |
| 0:02-0:14 | Each team member reports on commitments (~1.5 min each x 7 people) | All members |
| 0:14-0:19 | Review scoreboard together; discuss lead/lag trends | All members |
| 0:19-0:20 | Leader acknowledges wins, identifies areas needing support | Leader |
| 0:20-0:22 | Leader makes new commitment for the week | Leader |
| 0:22-0:28 | Each team member makes new commitment (~1 min each x 7 people) | All members |
| 0:28-0:30 | Leader closes; confirms all commitments recorded | Leader |

**Total: ~20-30 minutes**

## The Huddle Alternative (Abbreviated Format)

For teams needing faster cadence or daily touchpoints:
- **Duration:** 5-7 minutes
- **Difference:** Instead of individual commitments, the team as a whole makes ONE collective commitment for the period
- **Use case:** High-velocity environments, daily operations, construction, manufacturing floor teams

## What NOT to Discuss in a WIG Session

- Operational problems (the whirlwind)
- Administrative updates
- Project status unrelated to the WIG
- Personnel issues
- Budget discussions
- Anything that is not directly about moving the scoreboard

If operational issues surface during a WIG session, the leader says: "That's a whirlwind issue -- let's handle it in our separate staff meeting."

---

# WIG CASCADE: ORGANIZATIONAL TO TEAM LEVEL
<a name="wig-cascade"></a>

## The Cascade Structure

WIG creation begins at the TOP of the organization and cascades downward:

```
ORGANIZATIONAL WIG (set by senior leadership)
    |
    +--- DIVISION/DEPARTMENT WIG (supports org WIG)
    |       |
    |       +--- TEAM WIG (supports department WIG)
    |       |       |
    |       |       +--- Individual Lead Measure Commitments
    |       |
    |       +--- TEAM WIG
    |               |
    |               +--- Individual Lead Measure Commitments
    |
    +--- DIVISION/DEPARTMENT WIG
            |
            +--- TEAM WIG
                    |
                    +--- Individual Lead Measure Commitments
```

## The Cascade Process

### Step 1: Senior Leaders Define the Organizational WIG
- The top leadership team identifies the single most important goal for the organization
- Format: "From X to Y by When"
- This becomes the "North Star" that all lower-level WIGs must support

### Step 2: Department/Division Leaders Define Their WIGs
- Each department leader identifies how their function can MOST contribute to the organizational WIG
- Their WIG must directly support the organizational WIG
- They still follow the "From X to Y by When" format

### Step 3: Team Leaders Define Team WIGs
- Leaders at the lowest operational level establish team WIGs
- These must directly support the department/division WIG
- Teams CHOOSE their own WIGs (leadership can veto but cannot dictate)

### Step 4: Individual Commitments Flow Upward
- Each individual's weekly commitments in WIG sessions trace directly to team lead measures
- Lead measures trace to the team WIG
- Team WIG traces to the department WIG
- Department WIG traces to the organizational WIG

## The Critical Rule: "Leaders Veto, Never Dictate"

Senior leaders can reject a team's proposed WIG if it does not meaningfully support the organizational WIG. However, they CANNOT tell the team what their WIG should be. The reason: when people choose their own goals, commitment and ownership increase dramatically versus assigned goals.

## Organizational Transparency

Visible, cascading scoreboards allow leaders to track progress at every level. When scoreboard data flows upward:
- Senior leaders can see which teams are winning and which need support
- Coaching conversations become data-driven rather than opinion-based
- Cross-team collaboration opportunities become visible

---

# THE WHIRLWIND CONCEPT
<a name="whirlwind"></a>

## Definition

The **whirlwind** is the enormous amount of time and energy required to keep the organization at its current level of performance. It encompasses all the day-to-day operations, urgent tasks, unexpected problems, emails, meetings, reports, customer fires, and routine responsibilities that consume organizational capacity.

## The Whirlwind Is Not the Enemy -- But It Is the Rival

- The whirlwind is NOT unimportant -- you need these day-to-day operations to keep the organization running
- The whirlwind IS the enemy of execution on strategic goals
- You cannot eliminate the whirlwind
- You CAN protect strategic time FROM the whirlwind

## The 80/20 Allocation Rule

| Allocation | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **80%** of team time and energy | Sustaining the whirlwind (day-to-day operations) |
| **20%** of team time and energy | Focused, protected time on the WIG |

The whirlwind should not be allowed to consume more than 80% of workload. The remaining 20% is the strategic execution space where WIG work lives.

## How to Protect WIG Time from the Whirlwind

### Structural Protections

1. **Dedicated WIG Session (weekly):** A 20-30 minute meeting ONLY about the WIG; whirlwind discussion is forbidden
2. **Scheduled WIG Work Blocks:** Allocate specific calendar time for WIG-related activities; treat like a client meeting
3. **Separate Meeting Cadences:** Keep operational staff meetings completely separate from WIG sessions
4. **Lead Measure as Daily Priority:** Each person's weekly commitment becomes their non-negotiable daily priority above whirlwind tasks

### Behavioral Protections

1. **Leader Models the Behavior:** If the leader lets whirlwind consume WIG session time, the team will too
2. **"That's a Whirlwind Issue" Redirect:** Any time operational topics surface in WIG context, redirect immediately
3. **Scoreboard Visibility:** A visible scoreboard constantly reminds the team of the WIG's importance
4. **Peer Accountability:** Team members hold each other accountable; it's harder to let peers down than to let a boss down

### The Gravity Metaphor

During implementation (especially Stage 2: Launch), the whirlwind acts like gravity on a rocket. Launch requires "tremendous, highly focused energy" from leadership to overcome the pull of daily operations. Once the team reaches adoption velocity (Stage 3), the gravitational pull of the whirlwind weakens -- but never disappears entirely.

---

# IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE AND PHASES
<a name="implementation"></a>

## Overview: The 5 Stages of Behavioral Change

Full 4DX implementation spans **1-2 years** depending on organizational scale, business model complexity, and leadership commitment. Some sources indicate 2-3 years for medium-to-large organizations.

---

## Stage 1: GETTING CLEAR
**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks (pre-launch)

### What Happens:
- The leader and team commit to a new level of performance
- Team is oriented to the 4DX framework
- Crystal-clear WIGs are developed
- Lag measures are defined
- Lead measures are identified and selected
- A compelling scoreboard is designed
- Weekly WIG sessions are scheduled

### Leadership Actions:
- Model focus on the WIG
- Identify high-leverage lead measures
- Create the player's scoreboard (or oversee team creation)
- Schedule weekly WIG sessions on the calendar (same day, same time)
- Get certified in 4DX facilitation (typically 2 full days of training)

### Behavioral Indicators:
- Team members are still caught in daily operations
- Skepticism may be present
- Changing behavior proves challenging
- "Everything seems to have hit a roadblock; the team is still dragged into daily tasks"

---

## Stage 2: LAUNCH
**Timeline:** Weeks 1-4 of execution

### What Happens:
- Teams begin actual implementation of the 4DX process
- First WIG sessions are conducted
- Lead measures begin being tracked
- Scoreboard goes live

### Leadership Actions:
- Provide "tremendous, highly focused energy" -- like a rocket escaping gravity
- Maintain rigorous process adherence
- Identify three team segments:
  - **Models** (20%): Engaged, bought in, executing well
  - **Potentials** (60%): Struggling initially but open to change
  - **Resisters** (20%): Actively opposed or passively disengaged
- Focus coaching energy on Potentials (not Resisters)

### Behavioral Indicators:
- Reality proves more challenging than planning
- Motivation levels vary significantly across the team
- Some members may try to skip commitments or WIG sessions
- WIG sessions may feel awkward or forced

### Critical Risk:
This is where most 4DX implementations fail. If leadership does not maintain intense focus and discipline during the first 4 weeks, the whirlwind will pull the team back to old behaviors permanently.

---

## Stage 3: ADOPTION
**Timeline:** Weeks 5-12

### What Happens:
- Team members adopt the 4DX process as their own
- New behaviors begin driving WIG achievement
- Resistance fades; enthusiasm increases
- Team members become accountable to EACH OTHER (not just the leader)

### Leadership Actions:
- Prioritize process adherence over immediate results
- Hold weekly commitments and accountability sessions rigorously
- Track visible scoreboard results weekly
- Mentor Potentials toward Model behavior
- Address Resisters directly (performance conversations)
- Make necessary tactical adjustments to lead measures

### Behavioral Indicators:
- Teams feel like "winners for the first time in months"
- Members develop increased accountability toward each other
- Participation in WIG sessions becomes more engaged
- The scoreboard becomes a source of pride

---

## Stage 4: OPTIMIZATION
**Timeline:** Weeks 13-24+

### What Happens:
- Team shifts to a "4DX mindset": working with purpose, increased diligence, proactive approach
- Significant, measurable performance improvements appear
- Team members start looking for ways to optimize performance
- They now know what "playing to win" feels like

### Leadership Actions:
- Encourage creative ideas for advancing lead measures
- Celebrate execution excellence publicly
- Support mutual assistance among team members
- Recognize when Potentials reach Model performer status

### Behavioral Indicators:
- Consistent target metric improvements
- Excellent commitment fulfillment rates
- Enthusiastic participation in WIG sessions
- Meetings stay tightly focused on achieved results
- Team members voluntarily suggest new lead measures

---

## Stage 5: HABITS
**Timeline:** Month 6+ through perpetual operation

### What Happens:
- 4DX has become habitual within the team
- Superior results are generated consistently
- A permanent rise in the team's level of performance is established
- The organization develops a "culture of excellent execution"

### Leadership Actions:
- Celebrate WIG accomplishment
- Transition immediately to NEW WIGs (the process is never "done")
- Establish sustained performance standards
- Track individual high-performer development
- Begin spreading 4DX to additional teams

### Behavioral Indicators:
- Excellence becomes the operational standard
- New team members are onboarded into the 4DX culture naturally
- WIG sessions run themselves even when the leader is absent
- The team proactively identifies the next WIG

---

## Implementation Steps (Operational Sequence)

### Steps 1-3: Leader Certification (Before team launch)
- Senior leaders clarify organizational WIG
- Individual leaders define team WIGs and lead measures
- Typically 2 full days of training
- Leaders learn: facilitating WIG sessions, designing scoreboards, managing accountability

### Step 4: Team Launch (~2 hours)
- Leader presents the 4DX framework to the team
- Team collaboratively finalizes their WIG and lead measures
- Scoreboard is designed (ideally by the team)
- Ground rules are established
- First WIG session date is set

### Step 5: Execution with Coaching (Ongoing)
- Weekly WIG sessions commence
- Internal coaches (at least 2 per organization recommended) provide guidance
- Coach roles: operational repair, preventive maintenance, quarterly summit preparation
- First 90 days are the most critical coaching window

### Step 6: Quarterly Summit
- Leaders report results to senior peers
- Cross-organizational accountability reinforcement
- Share best practices across teams
- Recognize achievement; address underperformance
- Set trajectory for next quarter

**Quarterly Summit Presentation Format (per team):**

| Time | Item |
|------|------|
| 30 seconds | "What is your team's WIG(s) and why was it selected?" |
| 1 minute | "What are the lead measures?" |
| 1 minute | "Demonstrate the team's results using the scoreboard" |
| 3 minutes | "Pitch new WIGs and lead measures (if required)" |

# COMMON IMPLEMENTATION FAILURES AND HOW TO AVOID THEM
<a name="failures"></a>

## Failure 1: Too Many WIGs (Diluted Focus)

**The Problem:** Organizations try to execute 5-20 important goals simultaneously, spreading resources and attention so thin that nothing gets achieved.

**How to Avoid:** Enforce the "no more than 2 WIGs per team" rule ruthlessly. If leadership insists on more goals, those go into the whirlwind -- not the WIG framework. Focus is the first discipline for a reason.

---

## Failure 2: Treating 4DX as a Training Program, Not an Operating System

**The Problem:** Leaders attend the 4DX workshop, get excited, implement it for 3-4 weeks, then let it fade as the whirlwind reclaims their time. They treat 4DX as a "program" with a start and end date.

**How to Avoid:** 4DX must be embedded as the permanent framework for how strategic work gets done. It is not a project; it is the operating system. When one WIG is achieved, a new WIG takes its place immediately.

---

## Failure 3: Picking Non-Strategic WIGs

**The Problem:** Teams choose goals that are basic job requirements (hitting revenue targets, completing assigned projects, meeting sales quotas). "Profit is the price of entry for for-profit organizations" -- that is not a strategic WIG.

**How to Avoid:** WIGs must represent strategic breakthroughs: new customer growth, market share expansion, optimal product mix, cost structure transformation, capability building. If the goal is "do your job," it belongs in the whirlwind.

---

## Failure 4: Relying Only on Leveraged Behavior Lead Measures

**The Problem:** Teams rely solely on repetitive behavioral measures (e.g., "make 25 cold calls per day") which become engagement-killing and monotonous.

**How to Avoid:** Balance Leveraged Behaviors with Small Outcome lead measures that allow creative thinking. Examples: pipeline movement, milestone achievement, equipment availability. Small Outcomes let the team choose HOW to achieve the measure.

---

## Failure 5: Using the Scoreboard to "Name and Shame"

**The Problem:** Leaders weaponize the scoreboard to embarrass underperformers publicly. This destroys trust, kills innovation, and breeds fear.

**How to Avoid:** Use scoreboards to celebrate wins, highlight replicable excellence, and identify who needs support. Foster team accountability, not fear. "Shame crushes tolerance for vulnerability, thereby killing engagement, innovation, creativity, productivity, and trust."

---

## Failure 6: Getting Accountability Wrong (Top-Down Enforcement)

**The Problem:** Leaders see accountability as top-down enforcement rather than mutual peer commitment. This breeds compliance, not ownership.

**How to Avoid:** The equation is: **Goal Clarity + Commitment + Cadence = Results.** High clarity with low commitment creates only compliance. Peer accountability (team members to each other) is far more powerful than hierarchical accountability (boss to subordinate).

---

## Failure 7: Allowing the Whirlwind into WIG Sessions

**The Problem:** WIG sessions devolve into general staff meetings. Operational issues consume the 20-30 minutes. No commitments are made. The WIG becomes just another agenda item.

**How to Avoid:** Enforce the "whirlwind is NEVER allowed into a WIG session" rule absolutely. Have a separate meeting for operational issues. The moment someone raises a whirlwind topic, redirect: "That's important -- let's handle it in our operations meeting."

---

## Failure 8: Skipping or Inconsistent WIG Sessions

**The Problem:** WIG sessions get cancelled due to "busy schedules," holidays, travel, or competing priorities. Once momentum breaks, it rarely returns.

**How to Avoid:** The session must be at the same day and same time every week. NEVER miss it. If the leader cannot attend, someone else MUST run it. Your team will treat the WIG session with exactly as much importance as you do.

---

## Failure 9: Training Leaders at the Wrong Organizational Level

**The Problem:** If you certify leaders too HIGH in the hierarchy, the WIG won't reach the front lines where execution actually happens. If too LOW, they may lack the authority or skills to lead effectively.

**How to Avoid:** The ideal level for 4DX leadership is ONE level above frontline workers. These leaders have both operational knowledge and sufficient authority to drive change.

---

## Failure 10: Insufficient Internal Coaching Resources

**The Problem:** Teams struggle during the critical first 90 days and have no coaching support to repair breakdowns, maintain discipline, or troubleshoot.

**How to Avoid:** Designate at least 2 internal 4DX coaches per organization. Coach roles include: operational repair when the process breaks down, preventive maintenance to keep momentum, and quarterly summit preparation.

---

## Failure 11: Uncommitted Senior Leadership

**The Problem:** The senior leader sponsoring 4DX is not visibly committed. They don't attend WIG sessions, don't report on their own commitments, and don't hold other leaders accountable.

**How to Avoid:** The leader of 4DX must lead by example or no one else will embrace the process. Senior leaders must hold ALL leaders accountable. When leadership stops discussing 4DX, organizational commitment evaporates.

---

## Failure 12: Focusing on Lag Measures Instead of Lead Measures

**The Problem:** Teams become fixated on outcomes (revenue numbers, satisfaction scores) rather than proactively pursuing the lead measures that drive those outcomes.

**How to Avoid:** WIG sessions must focus on lead measures and weekly commitments. Lag measures are reviewed to confirm strategy is working, but they are NOT the point of focus if lead measures were selected correctly.
