# 1. JOBS TO BE DONE (JTBD) FRAMEWORK

## 1.1 How to Apply JTBD to Define Client Avatars for a Service Business

The JTBD framework (originated by Clayton Christensen) reframes client avatars away from demographics and toward the **progress clients are trying to make** when they hire your service. Instead of asking "Who is my client?" you ask "What job is my client hiring my service to do?"

### The Four-Step B2B JTBD Process

**Step 1: Choose Your Scope**
- Include prospective, existing, AND former clients
- Map multiple stakeholders: the person using your service is often not the person buying it
- Identify three roles: (1) Job Executor (primary user), (2) Product Lifecycle Support Team (implementers), (3) Economic Buyer (decision-maker)

**Step 2: Conduct Qualitative Research**
- Interview 7-10 clients minimum before looking for patterns
- Focus on clients at decision points: those who recently hired you or recently left
- Use the "Five Whys" technique to uncover root motivations
- Discover the "first thought" moment that started their search

**Step 3: Categorize Jobs**
- **Main Jobs**: Primary progress being pursued (e.g., "Grow revenue predictably")
- **Related Jobs**: Supporting tasks before, during, or after the main job (e.g., "Train the team on the new process")
- **Emotional Jobs**: Desired feelings during execution (e.g., "Feel confident presenting to the board")

**Step 4: Write Job Statements**
- Use standardized format: `[Verb] + [Object] + [Context]`
- Example: "Automate financial report generation at fiscal quarter end"
- Example: "Reduce client acquisition cost during scaling phase"

### Timeline: A directional JTBD insight base can be built in 3-6 weeks (customer interviews, win/loss, usage data). Quantifying desired outcomes and prioritization typically takes 6-10 additional weeks.

## 1.2 The Job Story Format with B2B Services Examples

### Standard Format

```
When [SITUATION/CONTEXT], I want to [MOTIVATION/FORCE], so I can [EXPECTED OUTCOME].
```

### B2B Service Business Examples

**For a Marketing Consultancy:**
```
FUNCTIONAL: When our lead pipeline has dried up and the sales team is idle,
I want to build a predictable inbound marketing system,
so I can generate 30+ qualified leads per month without depending on referrals.

EMOTIONAL: When I'm presenting quarterly results to the board,
I want to show clear ROI on our marketing spend,
so I can feel confident that my decisions are working and my job is secure.

SOCIAL: When I'm at the industry conference talking to peers,
I want to reference our sophisticated marketing approach,
so I can be seen as a forward-thinking leader, not someone flying blind.
```

**For a Financial Advisory Firm:**
```
FUNCTIONAL: When my business crosses $2M in revenue and tax complexity spikes,
I want to restructure my entity and tax strategy,
so I can keep more of what I earn and avoid costly compliance mistakes.

EMOTIONAL: When I lie awake at night worrying about an IRS audit,
I want to know every filing is buttoned up and defensible,
so I can sleep without the constant anxiety of financial exposure.

SOCIAL: When my business partner asks about our financial strategy,
I want to demonstrate we have a sophisticated plan in place,
so I can maintain their trust and confidence in my leadership.
```

**For an Operations/Systems Consultancy:**
```
FUNCTIONAL: When my team is drowning in manual processes and nothing scales,
I want to implement automated workflows and SOPs,
so I can double output without doubling headcount.

EMOTIONAL: When a key employee quits unexpectedly,
I want to know the business can run without any single person,
so I can feel like I own a real business, not a fragile house of cards.

SOCIAL: When potential acquirers or investors evaluate my company,
I want to show documented, repeatable systems,
so I can be perceived as running a scalable, valuable enterprise.
```

## 1.3 JTBD Discovery Interview Questions (Exact Questions)

### Pre-Interview Setup
- Interview 7-10 clients who either (a) hired you within the last 60 days, or (b) left/canceled within the last 60 days
- Conduct in pairs: one asks questions, one takes detailed notes
- Record all sessions for later review
- Allow 45-60 minutes per interview
- The richest insights typically emerge around the 20-25 minute mark

### The Complete JTBD Interview Script

**OPENING (Establish Context)**

1. "Tell me about how you came to hire us / purchase [service]. Start from the very beginning."
2. "When did you first start thinking about needing this kind of help?"
3. "Where were you -- physically and mentally -- when you realized you had this problem?"
4. "What was happening in your business at that moment?"

**FIRST THOUGHT (Discover the Trigger)**

5. "Can you remember the very first time the thought crossed your mind that you might need outside help with this?"
6. "What was the specific event or frustration that made you think 'something has to change'?"
7. "How long did you sit with that thought before you actually did anything about it?"

**PASSIVE LOOKING (Understand the Exploration Phase)**

8. "After you had that first thought, what did you do? Did you start researching immediately or did you wait?"
9. "Where did you go to look for information? Google? Asked peers? LinkedIn?"
10. "Did you talk to anyone else in your company about it? Who, and what did they say?"

**EVENT #1 (Identify the Catalyst)**

11. "Was there a specific moment where you went from 'I should probably look into this' to 'I need to solve this NOW'?"
12. "What changed? What happened that created urgency?"

**ACTIVE LOOKING (Map the Evaluation Process)**

13. "How did you go about finding potential providers or solutions?"
14. "Did you consider any alternatives to hiring a firm like ours? What were they?"
15. "What competitors or alternatives did you evaluate? Why those specifically?"
16. "What criteria were most important to you when comparing options?"
17. "Was anyone else involved in the decision? Who? What was their role?"

**EVENT #2 (The Purchase Trigger)**

18. "Why did you buy/hire on that specific day versus any other day?"
19. "Was there something that happened that made you say 'today is the day'?"

**THE DECISION**

20. "What ultimately made you choose us over the alternatives?"
21. "Was there anything that almost stopped you from moving forward?"
22. "What were your biggest concerns or anxieties about making this decision?"
23. "What would have had to be true for you NOT to have hired us?"

**THE OLD WAY**

24. "Before you hired us, what were you using or doing instead?"
25. "How well was that working? What specifically was falling short?"
26. "What had you tried before that didn't work?"

**OUTCOME EXPLORATION**

27. "When using our service, what are you ultimately trying to get done or accomplish?"
28. "If our service worked perfectly, what would be different in your business 12 months from now?"
29. "How do you measure whether this is working?"

**EMOTIONAL/SOCIAL PROBES**

30. "How did the old situation make you feel?"
31. "What would success with this look like to your boss / board / partners?"
32. "How do you think your team perceives this investment?"

### Key Probing Follow-Ups (Use Throughout)
- "Tell me more about that."
- "Why was that important to you?"
- "What do you mean by [term they used]?"
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "And then what happened?"
- Silence. (Let them fill the void -- the best insights come from pauses.)

## 1.5 The Forces of Progress Diagram Applied to B2B

### The Four Forces

When a B2B buyer considers switching to your service (or hiring you for the first time), four forces are at work. **If Push + Pull > Anxiety + Habit, they switch. If not, they stay with the status quo.**

```
         FORCES PROMOTING CHANGE              FORCES OPPOSING CHANGE
    ================================     ================================

    PUSH of the Current Situation         ANXIETY of the New Solution
    (Pain driving them away from          (Fear/uncertainty about
     the status quo)                       switching to you)

    "Our marketing isn't generating       "What if this consultant can't
     leads. We're leaving money on         deliver either? We've been
     the table every month."               burned before."

    "I've missed 3 growth targets         "What will my team think about
     in a row. The board is                bringing in outside help?
     asking questions."                    Will they resist?"

    PULL of the New Solution              HABIT of the Present
    (Attraction toward what you            (Comfort/familiarity with
     offer)                                current way of doing things)

    "They showed me a case study          "Our current process sort of
     of a similar company that             works. It's not great, but
     3x'd their leads in 6 months."        we know how it works."

    "Their methodology is proven          "Switching would mean retraining
     and they guarantee results."           the whole team. That's a huge
                                           disruption."
```

### B2B-Specific Force Intensifiers

**PUSH forces are strongest when:**
- Board/investors are applying pressure
- A competitor just leapfrogged them
- A key person quit and exposed fragility
- Revenue is declining or stagnant
- A compliance deadline is approaching

**PULL forces are strongest when:**
- You show proof from a similar company in their industry
- A trusted peer gave a referral
- Your content/thought leadership built credibility over time
- You offer a guarantee or risk-reversal

**ANXIETY forces are strongest in B2B when:**
- They've been burned by a previous consultant
- The investment is significant relative to their size
- Multiple stakeholders need to approve
- Implementation requires team behavior change
- Results aren't guaranteed or measurable

**HABIT forces are strongest when:**
- "The founder has always done it this way"
- Current vendor relationships are deeply embedded
- Switching costs are high (data migration, retraining)
- The team has built workarounds they're comfortable with

### How to Use This in Sales Conversations

1. **Amplify PUSH**: Ask about the cost of inaction. "What happens if nothing changes in the next 12 months?"
2. **Strengthen PULL**: Show proof, case studies, guarantees. "Here's exactly what happened for [similar company]."
3. **Reduce ANXIETY**: Offer pilots, phased approaches, money-back guarantees. "Let's start with a 90-day engagement."
4. **Weaken HABIT**: Make switching easy. "We handle the entire transition. Your team won't skip a beat."

## 1.6 JTBD Timeline Analysis Methodology

### The Six-Stage Purchase Timeline

Map every client's buying journey against these stages:

```
STAGE 1          STAGE 2          STAGE 3          STAGE 4          STAGE 5          STAGE 6
First            Passively        Event #1         Actively         Event #2         Decision/
Thought          Looking          (Catalyst)       Looking          (Purchase        Purchase
                                                                    Trigger)

"Something's     Casually         Something        Seriously        "We need to      Signs
not right..."    browsing,        creates          evaluating,      decide NOW."     contract
                 asking           urgency          comparing,
                 around                            demo calls

[Timeline: weeks to months]      [Often sudden]   [2-6 weeks]      [Often sudden]   [Days]
```

### How to Map the Timeline for Each Client

**Step 1: Identify the First Thought**
- When did they first realize they had a problem?
- What was happening in their business at that time?
- Who else noticed the problem?

**Step 2: Document the Passive Looking Phase**
- How long did they sit with the problem before acting?
- Where did they casually look for information?
- What content/people influenced them during this phase?

**Step 3: Pinpoint Event #1 (The Catalyst)**
- What specific event turned passive interest into active search?
- Common B2B catalysts: missed targets, lost a key client, board pressure, competitor move, key hire/departure

**Step 4: Map the Active Looking Phase**
- How did they find potential providers?
- Who else was involved in the evaluation?
- What criteria did they use to compare?
- How many alternatives did they seriously consider?

**Step 5: Pinpoint Event #2 (Purchase Trigger)**
- What made them decide on THAT day specifically?
- Common triggers: end of quarter, budget approval, competitive threat, personal commitment

**Step 6: Analyze the Decision**
- What tipped them toward you vs. alternatives?
- What almost stopped them?
- Who had final say?

### Pattern Recognition

After 7-10 interviews, look for:
- Common triggers (what events keep recurring?)
- Common timelines (how long from first thought to purchase?)
- Common anxieties (what fears keep showing up?)
- Common alternatives (who else do they consider?)
- Common evaluation criteria (what matters most?)

These patterns become the foundation of your marketing messaging, sales process, and client avatar definition.

## 2.3 The Negative ICP -- Who NOT to Sell To

### The Anti-Persona Framework

A Negative ICP is a data-driven representation of prospects who are poor fits due to budget constraints, misaligned needs, high churn potential, or other disqualifying factors. Your ICP should **disqualify at least 70% of inbound leads**.

### Negative ICP Template

| **Expectations** | Wants guaranteed results with minimal investment |
| **History** | Burned through 3+ vendors in 2 years |
| **Payment** | Disputes invoices, demands extended payment terms |
| **Communication** | Ghosts for weeks, then sends urgent demands at 11pm |
| **Scope** | Constant "one more thing" additions without paying |
| **Accountability** | "The last consultant didn't deliver either" |

**Example: "Non-Decision-Maker Nick"**

| Dimension | Red Flag Characteristics |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Authority** | Cannot sign off on purchases, researching "for the team" |
| **Title** | Coordinator, Assistant, Junior Analyst |
| **Budget** | "I don't know our budget" or "I'd need to ask" |
| **Timeline** | "Just exploring options for now" |
| **Process** | Cannot articulate success criteria when prompted |

### Instant Disqualification Triggers

- [ ] Industry on exclusion list
- [ ] No identified decision-maker after 2 conversations
- [ ] Budget below profitability floor
- [ ] Expects 24/7 availability or unrealistic turnaround
- [ ] Has cycled through 3+ similar vendors in 2 years
- [ ] Refuses to sign a contract or formal agreement
- [ ] Wants to "try a small project" to see if they like working with you (tire-kicker pattern)
- [ ] Primary driver is "we need this by next week" (crisis without commitment)
- [ ] Cannot articulate what success looks like

### Method 2: Quintile Method (Recommended, Data-Driven)

1. List all clients
2. Sort by Recency (most recent first) -- divide into 5 equal groups, top group = 5, bottom = 1
3. Sort by Frequency (most frequent first) -- divide into 5 equal groups, top group = 5, bottom = 1
4. Sort by Monetary (highest first) -- divide into 5 equal groups, top group = 5, bottom = 1
5. Each client now has a 3-digit RFM code (e.g., 5-5-5, 3-2-4, 1-1-1)

### Scoring Guide for Each Criterion

**Score 5 (Excellent):** Perfect fit. Exceeds criteria.
**Score 4 (Good):** Strong fit. Meets criteria well.
**Score 3 (Acceptable):** Adequate fit. Some gaps.
**Score 2 (Marginal):** Weak fit. Significant concerns.
**Score 1 (Poor):** Does not meet criteria. Major red flag.

### Calculating the Weighted Score

```
Weighted Score = Individual Score x Weight x 20

Example: Budget score of 4, weight of 15%
= 4 x 0.15 x 20 = 12 points (out of 15 maximum)

Maximum possible total = 100 points
```

| Total Score | Decision | Action |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| **85-100** | STRONG GO | Fast-track proposal. Assign best team. Prioritize. |
| **70-84** | GO | Proceed with standard proposal process. |
| **55-69** | CONDITIONAL GO | Proceed only if specific concerns can be resolved. Document conditions. |
| **40-54** | LEAN NO | Decline unless exceptional strategic reason. Require partner approval. |
| **Below 40** | HARD NO | Decline politely. Refer elsewhere if appropriate. |

### Additional Decision Rules

- **Any single criterion scored 1** = Automatic escalation to partner review
- **Budget AND Authority both below 3** = Automatic NO
- **3+ criteria scored 2 or below** = Automatic NO
- **Need score of 1** = Automatic NO (no urgent problem = no sale)

## 4.3 Red Flags That Disqualify Prospects

### Immediate Disqualification (Any ONE = Walk Away)

| # | Red Flag | Why It Matters |
|---|----------|---------------|
| 1 | **Abusive to your team** during sales process | It only gets worse after they pay you |
| 2 | **Cannot identify a decision-maker** after 2 meetings | You'll chase approvals forever |
| 3 | **Budget is below your floor** and they want to negotiate down | You'll lose money on the engagement |
| 4 | **They want guaranteed specific results** for variable services | Unrealistic expectations = inevitable conflict |
| 5 | **They've fired 3+ similar vendors** in 2 years | The problem is them, not the vendors |
| 6 | **They refuse to sign a contract** or formal agreement | No protection for either party |
| 7 | **They demand you start before paperwork is done** | Boundary violations escalate |
| 8 | **Their business is in serious financial distress** | They won't be able to pay you |

### Caution Flags (2+ = Reconsider, 3+ = Decline)

| # | Caution Flag | What to Watch For |
|---|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Extremely slow communication | Takes 1+ weeks to respond to simple questions |
| 2 | Scope keeps expanding in discovery | "Oh, and we also need..." repeatedly |
| 3 | Price is their primary evaluation criterion | "Who's cheapest?" vs "Who's best?" |
| 4 | They can't articulate what success looks like | Vague goals = impossible to satisfy |
| 5 | Multiple failed attempts at solving this problem | What makes you think you'll be different? |
| 6 | Key stakeholders aren't aligned | CTO wants X, CEO wants Y |
| 7 | They want "a little bit" to test you | Usually leads to unprofitable micro-project |
| 8 | They compare you to commoditized alternatives | "Why shouldn't we just use Fiverr?" |
| 9 | Excessive demands during sales process | "Can you do a free audit first?" |
| 10 | After-hours communication expectations | Texts at 10pm expecting immediate response |

# 5. PARETO PRINCIPLE & WHALE CURVE ANALYSIS

## 5.1 Revenue Concentration Research

### The 80/20 Rule in Service Businesses

The Pareto Principle, named after Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto (1896), states that roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. In service businesses:

- **80% of revenue** typically comes from **20% of clients**
- **80% of profits** come from **20% of clients**
- **80% of referrals** come from **20% of clients**
- **80% of headaches** come from **20% of clients** (often a DIFFERENT 20%)

### The Whale Curve: Beyond 80/20

Research from Harvard professors Robert Kaplan and V.G. Narayanan reveals that the 80/20 rule actually **understates** the concentration when it comes to profitability:

```
WHALE CURVE PROFIT DISTRIBUTION (Typical Service Business)

Cumulative

    Clients                                     Clients
```

### Key Data Points from Research

| Client Tier | % of Clients | Revenue Contribution | Profit Contribution |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Top 20%** | 20% | ~80% of revenue | **150-300% of actual net profit** |
| **Middle 60%** | 60% | ~15% of revenue | Break even (~0%) |
| **Bottom 20%** | 20% | ~5% of revenue | **Destroy 50-200% of profit** |

### What This Means Practically

For a service business with $1M in net profit:
- Your top clients generate $1.5M - $3M in profit
- Your middle clients generate roughly nothing after servicing costs
- Your bottom clients DESTROY $500K - $2M in profit
- The net result is your $1M actual profit

**If you eliminated or fixed the bottom 20%, your net profit could be 50-200% higher.**

## 5.2 Industry Benchmarks

### Revenue Concentration by Business Type

| Business Type | Top Client Revenue % | Top 3 Clients % | Recommended Max Single Client % |
|--------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Consulting Firms | 25-40% from #1 client | 50-70% | Below 25% |
| Marketing Agencies | 20-35% from #1 client | 40-60% | Below 20% |
| IT Services | 15-30% from #1 client | 35-55% | Below 15% |
| Accounting Firms | 10-20% from #1 client | 25-40% | Below 15% |
| Legal Services | 15-30% from #1 client | 35-55% | Below 20% |
| **Healthy Target** | **Below 15%** | **Below 40%** | **No single client > 15%** |

### Client Concentration Risk Levels

| Risk Level | Single Client Revenue % | Implication |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Low Risk** | No client > 10% | Highly diversified, sustainable |
| **Moderate Risk** | One client at 10-20% | Manageable with planning |
| **High Risk** | One client at 20-40% | Vulnerable, diversify urgently |
| **Critical Risk** | One client at 40%+ | Existential threat, crisis mode |

## 5.3 How to Identify and Protect "Whale" Clients

### Whale Client Identification

A whale client = any single client representing 20%+ of your revenue. Conduct this analysis quarterly:

1. **List all clients** by annual revenue (descending)
2. **Calculate each client's %** of total revenue
3. **Identify anyone above 15%** -- these are your whales
4. **Calculate "whale dependency ratio"**: Total whale revenue / Total revenue

### The Whale Protection Protocol

**LEVEL 1: RELATIONSHIP DEPTH (Ongoing)**

| Action | Frequency | Owner |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Executive-to-executive relationship building | Monthly | CEO/Partner |
| Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs) | Quarterly | Account Manager |
| Proactive value reporting | Monthly | Delivery Team |
| Multi-contact relationship mapping | Ongoing | Account Team |
| Industry insight sharing | Bi-weekly | Marketing |

Key principle: Build relationships with 3-5 contacts at the whale client, not just one. If your single contact leaves, the relationship is at risk.

**LEVEL 2: FINANCIAL PROTECTION (Structural)**

| Protection | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Cash reserve | Minimum 3 months of whale client revenue in reserve |
| Long-term contracts | 12-24 month agreements with termination notice requirements |
| Termination clause | 60-90 day notice period to provide transition time |
| The 20-20-60 Rule | Save 20% (emergency), Invest 20% (growth beyond whale), Operate on 60% |

**LEVEL 3: STRATEGIC DIVERSIFICATION (Proactive)**

| Strategy | Timeline |
|----------|----------|
| Never stop marketing even when whale is keeping you busy | Ongoing |
| Calculate your "magic number" of prospect conversations needed monthly | Monthly |
| Set a goal to reduce whale dependency by 5% per quarter | Quarterly |
| Develop a second whale to reduce single-point dependency | 6-12 months |
| Build productized/scalable service offerings alongside whale work | Ongoing |

---

## 5.4 Strategic Implications for Sales Focus

### The Revenue Prioritization Matrix

Based on Pareto analysis, allocate sales and account management time:

| Client Tier | % of Your Time | Activities |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| **Top 20% (A-Clients)** | 50% of time | Deep relationship management, QBRs, expansion, referral cultivation |
| **Next 30% (B-Clients)** | 30% of time | Upsell/cross-sell, move them toward A-tier, systematized nurturing |
| **Bottom 50% (C-Clients)** | 20% of time | Automated nurture only, self-service where possible, evaluate for exit |

### The "1-3-5" Sales Focus Rule

- **1** whale you're protecting and deepening
- **3** high-potential clients you're actively growing toward whale status
- **5** new prospects in active pipeline matching your ICP

# 6. FIRING BAD-FIT CLIENTS

## 6.1 The Decision Framework

### The Cost-of-Bad-Client Analysis

Before firing, quantify the true cost of keeping a bad-fit client:

**DIRECT COSTS:**

| Cost Category | Calculate |
|--------------|-----------|
| Revenue from this client | $_______ annually |
| Direct labor cost to serve them | $_______ (hours x rate) |
| Gross margin | Revenue - Direct Labor = $_______ |
| Gross margin % | _______ % (healthy = 30-60%) |

**HIDDEN COSTS:**

| Hidden Cost | Estimate |
|------------|----------|
| Extra revision/redo time not billed | _______ hours x $_______ = $_______ |
| Management time on firefighting | _______ hours x $_______ = $_______ |
| Opportunity cost (what you COULD bill) | _______ hours x $_______ rate = $_______ |
| Team stress/morale impact | (Subjective: Low / Medium / High) |
| Turnover risk (team members consider leaving) | (Subjective: Low / Medium / High) |
| Reputation risk (if they badmouth you) | (Subjective: Low / Medium / High) |

**THE CALCULATION:**

```
TRUE PROFITABILITY = Revenue - Direct Costs - Hidden Costs

If TRUE PROFITABILITY is negative or near zero:
  --> The client is costing you money. Fire them.

If TRUE PROFITABILITY is positive but opportunity cost is higher:
  --> The client is consuming capacity better used elsewhere. Fire them.

If TRUE PROFITABILITY is strong and hidden costs are low:
  --> The problem is manageable. Address specific issues before firing.
```

### The 5-Question Firing Decision Test

Answer honestly:

1. **Would you enthusiastically re-sign this client today, knowing what you know now?**
   - YES = Keep and fix issues
   - NO = Proceed to question 2

2. **Is the problematic behavior fixable through a direct conversation?**
   - YES = Have the conversation first (give 30 days)
   - NO = Proceed to question 3

3. **Is this client in your top 20% by revenue?**
   - YES = Extreme caution. Fix financially before firing. Find replacement revenue first.
   - NO = Proceed to question 4

4. **Does this client negatively affect your team's morale or other client relationships?**
   - YES = Fire them. Team health > revenue.
   - NO = Proceed to question 5

5. **If you freed up the capacity this client consumes, could you fill it with better-fit work?**
   - YES = Fire them and pursue better clients.
   - NO = Keep them while building pipeline, then fire when replacement is secured.

## 6.2 When to Fire a Client -- Criteria Checklist

### HBR's Four Criteria (from Harvard Business Review)

| Criterion | Description | Action |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Work Misalignment** | Assignments no longer match your expertise or strategic direction | Refer the work elsewhere |
| **Time Waste** | Client demands excessive face-time without strategic value | Phase out at contract renewal |
| **Underpricing Lock-in** | You've outgrown your fee structure but client resists increases | Move to clients who don't blink at your rates |
| **Perpetual Dissatisfaction** | Unrealistic expectations that can never be met | Have one clarifying conversation, then exit |

### Additional Service Business Triggers

- Client treats your team disrespectfully
- Chronic late payments (45+ days past terms, repeatedly)
- Constant scope creep without additional compensation
- Micromanagement that prevents effective work
- Requests that cross ethical or legal boundaries
- Client's business is failing and they can't sustain your fees
- You've outgrown the work and it's beneath your capability level

## 6.3 Conversation Scripts and Approaches

### General Principles

1. **Never fire a client when you're angry.** Sleep on it. Make the decision with a clear head.
2. **Finish current obligations first.** Complete what you've committed to.
3. **Do it in person or by phone, then confirm in writing.** Never fire by email alone.
4. **Shift blame to yourself** -- frame it as your changing direction, not their bad behavior.
5. **Always offer a referral** to another provider if appropriate.
6. **Set a clear end date** and transition plan.

### SCRIPT 1: "Strategic Shift" (The Cleanest Exit)

Best for: Clients where you simply want to move on without drama.

```
"[Name], I wanted to reach out personally because I have a lot of respect for
you and your business.

After evaluating our firm's strategic direction, we've decided to narrow our
focus to [specific niche/service]. This means that as of [date -- typically
60-90 days out], we'll no longer be in a position to serve you the way you
deserve.

I want to make sure this transition is seamless for you. Here's what I propose:

1. We'll complete all current work through [specific deliverables]
2. I'll personally introduce you to [2-3 alternative providers] who would be
   a great fit
3. We'll provide a full handoff document with everything the next team needs

I've truly valued our partnership, and I want to make sure you're set up for
continued success. Can we schedule a 30-minute call this week to map out the
transition?"
```

### SCRIPT 2: "Personal Reasons" (The Flexible Exit)

Best for: When you want to keep it simple without detailed explanation.

```
"[Name], it's been great working together. Due to [personal reasons / changes
in my business], as of [date] I'm no longer going to be able to assist you.

I know it's short notice, but I felt some notice was better than none. I'll
do my best to make sure there aren't any issues during the transition process.

Here's what you can expect from me between now and [date]:
- [Specific deliverable 1]
- [Specific deliverable 2]
- [Transition documentation]
- [Introductions to alternatives]

Thanks for your understanding and support."

## 6.4 Financial Impact Analysis: Keeping vs. Firing

### The Replacement Revenue Calculation

```
STEP 1: Calculate Current Revenue Impact
  Bad-fit client annual revenue:                    $________
  Your total annual revenue:                        $________
  % of total:                                       ________%

STEP 2: Calculate True Cost of Keeping
  Revenue from bad-fit client:                      $________
  MINUS direct labor costs:                       - $________
  MINUS hidden costs (revisions, firefighting):   - $________
  MINUS opportunity cost of time:                 - $________
  = TRUE ANNUAL VALUE OF KEEPING:                   $________

STEP 3: Calculate Value of Freed Capacity
  Hours currently spent on bad-fit client:          ________ hrs/year
  Your blended billing rate:                        $________/hr
  Utilization rate for freed capacity (est. 60-80%): ________%
  = POTENTIAL REVENUE FROM FREED CAPACITY:          $________

STEP 4: Compare
  True value of KEEPING bad-fit client:             $________
  Potential value of REPLACING with good-fit work:  $________
  NET BENEFIT OF FIRING:                            $________
```

### Common Finding

In most analyses, the net benefit of firing a bad-fit client is **positive**, often significantly so. A client generating $100K in revenue but consuming $80K in direct costs and $40K in hidden costs is actually costing you $20K per year. Replacing them with a good-fit client at the same revenue but 50% margins nets you $50K -- a $70K swing.

### The "Firing Improves Everything" Effect

Research and practitioner experience consistently shows that firing bad-fit clients:

1. **Immediately improves team morale** -- the relief is palpable
2. **Frees capacity** for higher-value work
3. **Reduces operational complexity** (fewer fires to fight)
4. **Improves client satisfaction scores** (bad clients skew NPS/CSAT down)
5. **Creates space for growth** -- you can't say YES to great clients when bad clients fill your capacity
6. **Forces pipeline discipline** -- you'll be more selective going forward

# APPENDIX A: INTEGRATED CLIENT AVATAR DEFINITION PROCESS

## The Complete 8-Step Process

Combining all frameworks above into a single workflow:

```
STEP 1: PARETO ANALYSIS (Week 1)
  --> List all clients by revenue
  --> Identify top 20% and bottom 20%
  --> Build the whale curve
  --> Quantify the gap between actual and potential profit

STEP 2: RFM SEGMENTATION (Week 1)
  --> Score all clients on R, F, M
  --> Segment into the 11 categories
  --> Identify Champions, At Risk, and Lost

STEP 3: JTBD INTERVIEWS (Weeks 2-4)
  --> Interview 7-10 top clients (Champions from RFM + top 20% from Pareto)
  --> Map their functional, emotional, and social jobs
  --> Document the purchase timeline
  --> Identify the Forces of Progress

STEP 4: ICP DOCUMENTATION (Week 4-5)
  --> Using interview data + Pareto/RFM analysis, build your ICP
  --> Document all 7 pillars (firmographic, technographic, behavioral, etc.)
  --> Create the weighted scoring model
  --> Define the Negative ICP

STEP 5: CLIENT SCORECARD BUILD (Week 5)
  --> Create the pre-qualification scorecard
  --> Set go/no-go thresholds
  --> Define red flags and disqualifiers
  --> Train the team on using it

STEP 6: WHALE PROTECTION PLAN (Week 6)
  --> Identify all whale clients
  --> Implement the protection protocol
  --> Set up QBR cadence
  --> Build diversification plan

STEP 7: BAD-FIT CLIENT AUDIT (Week 6-7)
  --> Score all current clients against your new ICP
  --> Identify clients in the "Avoid/Fire" quadrant
  --> Run the cost-benefit analysis for each
  --> Create a phased exit plan

STEP 8: ONGOING OPTIMIZATION (Monthly)
  --> Re-run RFM analysis monthly
  --> Score all new prospects with the scorecard
  --> Review whale concentration quarterly
  --> Update ICP annually based on new data
```
