## 1. Reversible vs Irreversible Decisions (Bezos Type 1 vs Type 2)

### Name, Source, and Evidence Base

- **Name:** Type 1 / Type 2 Decision Framework (One-Way Door / Two-Way Door)
- **Source:** Jeff Bezos, Amazon 2015 Annual Shareholder Letter
- **Evidence Base:** Amazon grew from $107B to $574B in revenue (2015-2023) operating under this exact framework. Bezos credits this approach as central to maintaining startup-speed decision-making at massive scale.

### The Framework Explained

Bezos wrote in his 2015 letter to shareholders:

> "Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible -- one-way doors -- and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don't like what you see on the other side, you can't get back to where you were before. We can call these **Type 1 decisions.**"
>
> "But most decisions aren't like that -- they are changeable, reversible -- they're two-way doors. If you've made a suboptimal Type 2 decision, you don't have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. **Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high-judgment individuals or small groups.**"

### The Critical Insight for SMB Owners

Bezos identified the core failure mode:

> "As organizations get larger, there seems to be a tendency to use the heavy-weight Type 1 decision-making process on most decisions, including many Type 2 decisions. The end result of this is **slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion, failure to experiment sufficiently, and consequently diminished invention.**"

For SMBs ($500K-$50M), this manifests as: every decision flows up to the CEO because there is no classification system. The owner becomes a bottleneck not because they need to decide, but because nobody knows which decisions require them.

### How to Classify Every Decision

Use this four-question filter to classify any decision in under 60 seconds:

| Question | If YES | If NO |
|----------|--------|-------|
| 1. If this goes wrong, can we reverse it within 30 days at less than $5K cost? | Leans Type 2 | Leans Type 1 |
| 2. Does this affect fewer than 3 departments or fewer than 5 people? | Leans Type 2 | Leans Type 1 |
| 3. Is this a decision we (or the industry) have made before with known outcomes? | Leans Type 2 | Leans Type 1 |
| 4. Would the wrong choice threaten our reputation, legal standing, or survival? | TYPE 1 | Leans Type 2 |

**Scoring:**
- 3-4 "Leans Type 2" answers = **TYPE 2** -- delegate immediately
- 2 of each = **Type 1.5** -- delegate with defined guardrails and a check-in
- 3-4 "Leans Type 1" answers = **TYPE 1** -- CEO decides with full deliberation

### Different Processes for Each Type

#### Type 1 Process (The Heavyweight)
**Time investment:** 2-10 hours per decision
**Who:** CEO + relevant senior leaders + affected stakeholders
**Steps:**
1. Define the decision clearly in writing (1 page max)
2. Identify what makes this irreversible (the specific one-way door element)
3. Gather data from at least 3 sources/perspectives
4. Write out the top 3 options with pros/cons
5. Assign a devil's advocate to argue against the preferred option
6. Sleep on it (minimum 24-hour waiting period for decisions over $25K impact)
7. Make the decision and document the rationale in the decision journal
8. Communicate to all affected parties within 24 hours

**Examples for SMBs:** Signing a 5-year lease, firing a senior leader, taking on significant debt, changing the business model, entering a new market, major technology platform change, M&A.

#### Type 2 Process (The Lightweight)
**Time investment:** 5-30 minutes per decision
**Who:** The most relevant individual or a small team (2-3 people)
**Steps:**
1. The person closest to the information decides
2. Use the 70% information rule: if you have 70% of the information you wish you had, decide now
3. Set a "by when" (decision must be made within 24-48 hours)
4. Communicate the decision to those who need to know
5. Monitor for 2-4 weeks; reverse if needed

**Examples for SMBs:** Choosing a vendor for office supplies, approving a marketing campaign variation, hiring a contractor for a defined project, selecting which conference to attend, adjusting a process.

### Daily Application

**Every morning (5 minutes):** Review your calendar and inbox. For each decision that lands on your desk, ask: "Is this a one-way door or a two-way door?" If it is a two-way door, immediately route it to the appropriate person with the instruction: "This is a two-way door. You decide. Let me know what you chose."

**Every evening (3 minutes):** Log any Type 1 decisions you identified that day into your decision journal. Note any Type 2 decisions you caught yourself holding onto that should have been delegated.

### Weekly Application

**Monday planning (15 minutes):** Review the week's pending decisions. Classify each as Type 1 or Type 2. Block calendar time only for Type 1 decisions. Assign Type 2 decisions to team members with a deadline.

**Friday review (10 minutes):** Count how many decisions you personally made this week. Calculate the Type 1 to Type 2 ratio. Target: 80%+ of your personal decisions should be Type 1. If you are making Type 2 decisions, you are the bottleneck.

### Metrics and Success Criteria

| Metric | Baseline (Month 1) | Target (Month 3) | Target (Month 6) |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Total decisions made by CEO per week | Track baseline | Reduce by 30% | Reduce by 50% |
| % of CEO decisions that are Type 1 | Track baseline | 60% | 80%+ |
| Average time to make Type 2 decisions (company-wide) | Track baseline | Under 48 hours | Under 24 hours |
| Type 2 decisions delegated per week | Track baseline | +5 per week | +10 per week |

### Time Investment Required

- **Setup:** 2 hours to create your classification guide and train your leadership team
- **Ongoing:** 10-15 minutes per day (classification + routing)
- **Weekly review:** 25 minutes

### Expected Impact Timeline

- **Week 1-2:** Awareness -- you start noticing how many Type 2 decisions you are making
- **Week 3-4:** First delegation wave -- you route 5-10 Type 2 decisions per week to others
- **Month 2-3:** Team adapts -- they start classifying decisions themselves before bringing them to you
- **Month 4-6:** Cultural shift -- "Is this a one-way door?" becomes common language in the company

### How This Prevents the Firefighter CEO Pattern

The firefighter CEO treats every decision as a fire that requires their personal attention. The Type 1/Type 2 framework reveals that **80-90% of "fires" are actually two-way doors** -- low-risk, reversible decisions that feel urgent but do not require the CEO. By classifying before reacting, the CEO breaks the cycle of treating every incoming request as a crisis. The team learns that most decisions can be made locally, and only genuine one-way doors escalate to the CEO.

## 2. RAPID Decision Framework (Bain & Company)

### Name, Source, and Evidence Base

- **Name:** RAPID Decision-Making Framework
- **Source:** Bain & Company (proprietary framework, developed in the early 2000s)
- **Evidence Base:** Bain surveyed almost 800 companies and found a **95% correlation between companies that excel at making and executing key decisions and those with top-tier financial results**, measured by revenue growth, return on capital, and total shareholder return. Companies implementing RAPID report 20-30% faster decision cycles.

### The Framework Explained

RAPID is an acronym that defines five distinct roles in any decision. The order of the acronym is not the order of operations -- the actual decision flow is: **Input -> Recommend -> Agree -> Decide -> Perform.**

| Role | Definition | Key Responsibility | Rules |
|------|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| **R - Recommend** | The person or team that drives the process | Gathers data, analyzes options, develops the proposal | Must actively seek Input; cannot also be the Decider |
| **A - Agree** | Must formally agree the recommendation is feasible | Ensures compliance with legal, regulatory, financial, or safety requirements | Has effective veto power on feasibility (not preference); if they disagree, must work with Recommender to reach a viable proposal |
| **P - Perform** | Accountable for executing the decision | Implements the decision once made | Must be assigned before or immediately after the decision; must understand the intent, not just the action |
| **I - Input** | Provides data, expertise, or perspective | Shapes the recommendation with relevant knowledge | Input is consulted but does not have veto power; the Recommender weighs Input, not the Decider |
| **D - Decide** | Makes the final call | Commits the organization to action | There must be ONE and only ONE Decider per decision; the Decider is accountable for the outcome |

### Exact Implementation Steps for an SMB ($500K-$50M)

**Step 1: Identify Your Top 15-20 Recurring Decisions (Week 1)**

List the decisions that recur weekly, monthly, or quarterly. Examples for an SMB:

| Decision | Frequency |
|----------|-----------|
| Approve spending over $X threshold | Weekly |
| Hire/fire team members | As needed |
| Pricing changes | Monthly/Quarterly |
| New client/contract acceptance | Weekly |
| Marketing campaign approval | Monthly |
| Vendor selection | As needed |
| Product/service changes | Monthly |
| Cash flow allocation | Weekly |
| Performance issue escalation | As needed |
| Technology tool adoption | Quarterly |

**Step 2: Assign RAPID Roles to Each Decision (Week 1-2)**

For each of the 15-20 decisions, fill out this table:

| Decision | R (Recommend) | A (Agree) | P (Perform) | I (Input) | D (Decide) |
|----------|--------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Spending > $5K | Dept. Head | Finance Lead | Dept. Head | Affected teams | CEO |
| Hiring (non-senior) | Hiring Mgr | HR / Finance | Hiring Mgr + HR | Team Lead | Dept. Head |
| Pricing changes | Sales Lead | Finance Lead | Sales Team | Customer Success, Marketing | CEO |
| Marketing campaigns | Marketing Lead | Finance Lead | Marketing Team | Sales, Product | Marketing Lead |

**In smaller teams (under 15 people):** One person may hold multiple roles across different decisions. The Marketing Lead might be the Recommender on campaigns but only an Input provider on pricing. The critical rule: even if roles overlap, you still go through the mental process of each role separately.

**Step 3: Publish and Train (Week 2-3)**

- Create a one-page "Decision Rights Map" and post it where everyone can see it (shared drive, office wall, Slack channel)
- Hold a 60-minute team meeting to walk through each decision and its RAPID roles
- Run through 2-3 recent real decisions using the RAPID framework to practice

**Step 4: Pilot on 5 Decisions (Week 3-6)**

- Choose 5 of the most frequent decisions to run through RAPID
- After each decision, do a 5-minute debrief: Was the process clear? Did anyone feel their role was wrong?
- Adjust role assignments based on feedback

**Step 5: Expand to All Key Decisions (Month 2-3)**

- Roll out RAPID to all 15-20 mapped decisions
- Create a simple tracking log: Decision, Date, D (who decided), Outcome

**Step 6: Quarterly RAPID Audit (Ongoing)**

- Review the Decision Rights Map every quarter
- Ask: "Are the right people in the right roles? Are decisions moving at the right speed? Are outcomes improving?"
- Adjust as the team grows or changes

### Daily Application

**Each morning:** When a decision request arrives, your first response should be: "Who is the R on this? Have they gathered I and gotten A?" If not, route it back. The CEO should only receive decisions where they are the designated D.

**When a team member brings a decision to you:** Ask: "Are you bringing this to me as Input, as a Recommendation, or because you need me to Decide?" This single question retrains how your team communicates with you.

### Weekly Application

**Monday team standup (add 5 minutes):** Ask each department head: "What decisions are pending this week, and who is the D on each?" This ensures decisions are not orphaned or stuck.

**Friday decision review (10 minutes):** Review decisions made that week. Were the RAPID roles followed? Did any decisions stall because roles were unclear?

### Metrics and Success Criteria

| Metric | How to Measure | Target |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Decision speed | Days from recommendation to decision | Reduce by 25% in 90 days |
| Decision quality | % of decisions that achieved intended outcome at 90-day review | Track baseline, then improve by 10% |
| Decision effort | Survey team monthly: "How much effort did decisions take this month?" (1-4 scale) | Reduce effort score by 1 point within 6 months |
| Role clarity | Survey: "Do you know your role in each key decision?" | 90%+ "yes" within 60 days |
| CEO bottleneck | # of decisions waiting on CEO per week | Reduce by 50% in 90 days |

### Time Investment Required

- **Setup:** 4-6 hours over 2 weeks (mapping decisions, assigning roles, training)
- **Ongoing daily:** 5-10 minutes (routing and coaching)
- **Weekly review:** 15 minutes
- **Quarterly audit:** 1-2 hours

### Expected Impact Timeline

- **Week 1-2:** Awareness phase -- team learns the vocabulary (R, A, P, I, D)
- **Week 3-6:** Pilot phase -- 5 decisions run through RAPID; you discover role confusion
- **Month 2-3:** Acceleration -- 80% of mapped decisions follow RAPID; CEO decision load drops noticeably
- **Month 4-6:** Institutionalization -- team self-organizes around RAPID roles; new decisions are automatically mapped

### How This Prevents the Firefighter CEO Pattern

The firefighter CEO gets pulled into every decision because nobody knows who should decide. RAPID eliminates this by **pre-assigning the Decider for every recurring decision.** When a team member has a question, they do not default to "ask the CEO" -- they check the Decision Rights Map. The CEO only receives decisions where they are the designated D (typically Type 1, high-stakes decisions). This alone can reduce CEO decision volume by 40-60%.

## 3. The Decision Filter Concept

### Name, Source, and Evidence Base

- **Name:** CEO Decision Filter / Decision Rights Matrix / Urgency-Stakes Matrix
- **Sources:** Multiple -- including Harvard Business Review, MIT Sloan Management Review, McKinsey, The CEO Project, and Deliberate Directions consulting frameworks
- **Evidence Base:** Research from Harvard Business School found that CEOs spend 36% of their time in reactive mode handling unfolding issues. A well-constructed decision filter can reclaim 60-80% of that reactive time. Organizations with clear decision rights outperform those without by a factor of 2x on revenue growth (Bain).

### What Is a Decision Filter?

A decision filter is a pre-defined set of criteria that determines which decisions reach the CEO and which are handled at lower levels. It answers the question: **"Should I be making this decision, or should someone else?"**

### The Four-Quadrant Urgency-Stakes Filter

This filter classifies every incoming decision along two axes:

```
                        HIGH STAKES
                            |
         ESCALATE           |         CEO DECIDES
         IMMEDIATELY        |         (Type 1)
         (Crisis mode:      |         (Strategic, irreversible,
          CEO + team)       |          cross-functional)
                            |
   URGENT ─────────────────+──────────────── NOT URGENT
                            |
         DELEGATE           |         INFORM ON
         (Does not require  |         PROGRESS
          CEO skill set)    |         (Important but CEO
                            |          monitors, does not decide)
                            |
                        LOW STAKES
```

### Specific Filter Criteria: What Should NEVER Reach the CEO

The following decisions should **never** reach the CEO's desk in an SMB with a functioning leadership team:

| Decision Category | Examples | Who Decides Instead |
|------------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Operational execution** | Daily scheduling, task assignment, process adjustments | Department heads / Team leads |
| **Spending under threshold** | Purchases under $1,000-$5,000 (set your threshold) | Budget owner with pre-approved limits |
| **Routine HR** | PTO approvals, schedule changes, minor policy questions | HR lead or direct manager |
| **Customer service issues** | Refunds under $X, standard complaints, shipping problems | Customer service lead with defined playbook |
| **Vendor management** | Reordering supplies, routine vendor communication, invoice processing | Operations manager |
| **Technical implementation** | How to build a feature, which tool to use for a task, code deployment | Technical lead |
| **Content & messaging** | Social media posts, blog topics, email copy | Marketing lead within brand guidelines |
| **Routine sales** | Standard proposals, follow-ups, pipeline management | Sales lead within pricing guidelines |

### Specific Filter Criteria: What MUST Reach the CEO

| Filter Criterion | Why It Requires the CEO | Examples |
|-----------------|----------------------|----------|
| **Irreversible and high-cost** (>5% of annual revenue) | Cannot be undone; material financial impact | Signing a major lease, large capital expenditure, debt agreements |
| **Cross-functional with conflict** | Requires authority that spans departments | Prioritizing one department's needs over another, resource reallocation |
| **Reputation or legal risk** | Potential to damage brand, invite lawsuits, or violate regulations | PR crisis response, legal disputes, regulatory compliance decisions |
| **People (senior leadership)** | Hiring, firing, or compensating senior leaders | C-suite/VP hires and terminations, equity grants |
| **Strategic direction** | Defines what the company is or will become | New market entry, product line addition/removal, business model change |
| **Culture-defining** | Sets precedent for organizational values | Exception to a policy that could set new norms, values violations |
| **Existential** | Threatens the survival of the business | Cash flow crisis, loss of a >20% revenue client, force majeure events |

### Building Your Personal Decision Filter (Step-by-Step)

**Step 1: Track for 2 weeks (5 min/day)**
Log every decision you make. For each, note: What was it? Could someone else have made it? Why did it come to me?

**Step 2: Categorize using the filter criteria above (2 hours)**
Sort your 2-week log into "Must be CEO" and "Should not have been CEO." Most leaders find that 60-80% of their decisions fall in the second category.

**Step 3: Build your Decision Rights Matrix (3 hours)**
Create a document listing 40-60 recurring decisions across your business. For each, assign:
- The decision owner (who decides)
- The decision threshold (at what dollar amount or risk level it escalates)
- The communication requirement (who needs to know after the decision is made)
- The frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual)

**Step 4: Set dollar thresholds (1 hour)**
Define clear spending authority:
- **Team member:** Up to $250 without approval
- **Team lead/manager:** Up to $1,000 without approval
- **Department head:** Up to $5,000 without approval
- **CEO:** Above $5,000 (adjust these to your revenue level -- a general rule is 0.1-1% of monthly revenue per tier)

**Step 5: Create escalation playbooks (4-6 hours over 2 weeks)**
For each decision category that is being delegated, write a one-page playbook:
- The decision criteria (when to say yes, when to say no)
- The boundaries (what they can never do without CEO approval)
- The communication protocol (who to inform and by when)

**Step 6: Publish and train (2 hours)**
Share the Decision Rights Matrix with your entire leadership team. Walk through it. Post it where everyone can reference it.

### Daily Application

**Morning filter (3 minutes):** Review your inbox and task list. For each item, ask: "Does this pass my CEO filter?" If it does not (meaning someone else should handle it), immediately forward it to the right person with a note: "You own this. Decide by [date]. Let me know the outcome."

**When someone brings you a decision in person:** Ask three questions before engaging:
1. "Does this fall within your decision authority?"
2. "Have you consulted the relevant people?"
3. "What do you recommend?"
If the answer to #1 is "yes," say: "Then you decide. I trust you."

### Weekly Application

**Monday (10 minutes):** Review the Decision Rights Matrix against the week ahead. Are there any pending decisions that are incorrectly assigned or stuck?

**Friday (15 minutes):** Review decisions that came to you this week. For each, ask: "Should this have come to me?" Track the percentage that should NOT have. Your goal is to get this to under 20%.

### Metrics and Success Criteria

| Metric | Baseline | 90-Day Target | 6-Month Target |
|--------|----------|--------------|----------------|
| Decisions reaching CEO per week | Track baseline | Reduce by 40% | Reduce by 60-80% |
| % of CEO decisions that are strategic (Type 1) | Track baseline | 50% | 75%+ |
| Hours/week CEO spends on decisions below their filter | Track baseline | Reduce by 50% | Reduce by 80% |
| Team confidence in decision authority (survey, 1-5) | Baseline survey | 3.5+ | 4.0+ |
| Decisions stalled waiting for CEO | Track baseline | Reduce by 50% | Near zero |

### Time Investment Required

- **Setup:** 12-15 hours over 2-3 weeks (tracking, categorizing, building matrix, creating playbooks)
- **Ongoing daily:** 3-5 minutes (filtering incoming decisions)
- **Weekly review:** 25 minutes
- **Quarterly update:** 2-3 hours (revising thresholds and adding new decision categories)

### Expected Impact Timeline

- **Week 1-2:** Tracking phase -- you simply observe and log decisions (no changes yet)
- **Week 3-4:** Filter goes live -- you start redirecting decisions to the right people
- **Month 2:** Push-back phase -- team initially pushes decisions back to you ("Are you sure?"). Hold the line.
- **Month 3:** Adoption -- team begins self-filtering; you see a measurable drop in CEO decisions
- **Month 4-6:** Maturity -- the filter is cultural; decisions flow to the right level automatically

### How This Prevents the Firefighter CEO Pattern

The firefighter CEO has no filter -- every decision is treated as equally important and equally requiring the CEO. The Decision Filter creates a clear sorting mechanism: most "fires" are not actually fires (they are low-stakes, reversible, operational decisions that belong to someone else). By defining in advance what qualifies as a CEO-level decision, the CEO stops reacting to every incoming request and instead only engages with decisions that truly require their authority, judgment, and strategic perspective. Research shows this can reclaim 10-20 hours per week for the average SMB CEO.

## 4. The 6 Levels of Delegation

### Name, Source, and Evidence Base

- **Name:** The 6 Levels of Delegation (also referenced as 5 levels, or 7 levels depending on the framework version)
- **Sources:**
  - **Ari Meisel** (productivity expert, author of "Less Doing, More Living") -- the 6-level model
  - **Jim Schleckser / The CEO Project** -- the 5-level model (Levels 0-5)
  - **Jurgen Appelo** (Management 3.0) -- the 7-level model
- **Evidence Base:** In a Gallup study, CEOs who reported high delegation effectiveness showed an average 3-year company growth rate of 1,751% -- over 112 percentage points higher than low-delegation CEOs. Organizations prioritizing delegation see 3.5x faster decision-making and 50% higher employee retention.

### The Complete 6-Level Framework

This synthesizes the Meisel and Schleckser models into a single practical framework:

#### Level 1: "Do Exactly As I Say"

- **Description:** You provide complete, step-by-step instructions. The team member executes exactly as directed with no independent judgment.
- **CEO Action:** Write out the exact steps. The delegate follows them verbatim.
- **Example:** "Go to Amazon. Search for [specific product]. Order the one that is $29.99. Use the company card. Ship to the office."
- **When to use:** Brand-new employees, completely new tasks, zero-error-tolerance tasks (regulatory filings, wire transfers).
- **Team member maturity:** New hire, untested, or learning a new domain.
- **CEO time investment:** HIGH -- you must create detailed instructions upfront.

#### Level 2: "Look Into This and Report Back"

- **Description:** You delegate the research. The team member investigates and presents findings, but YOU make the decision.
- **CEO Action:** Define what you need to know. The delegate becomes your "human search engine."
- **Example:** "Research the top 5 CRM systems for businesses our size. Compare pricing, features, and reviews. Give me a summary by Friday."
- **When to use:** When the CEO lacks information but must make the final call, or when training someone in a new area.
- **Team member maturity:** Developing; showing initiative but not yet trusted to recommend.
- **CEO time investment:** MEDIUM -- you review their research and decide.

#### Level 3: "Give Me Options and a Recommendation, I'll Decide"

- **Description:** The team member researches, analyzes, narrows options, and recommends a course of action. The CEO reviews and makes the final decision.
- **CEO Action:** Review the recommendation, ask clarifying questions, then approve or redirect.
- **Example:** "Evaluate our three vendor options for the new warehouse. Recommend one with your reasoning. I'll make the final call."
- **When to use:** Important decisions where the team member has growing expertise; medium-stakes decisions.
- **Team member maturity:** Competent; has demonstrated good judgment in their domain.
- **CEO time investment:** MEDIUM-LOW -- you review a recommendation rather than starting from scratch.

#### Level 4: "Decide and Check With Me Before Acting"

- **Description:** The team member makes the decision independently but pauses before execution to get CEO confirmation. This is an "opt-in" model: they decide, but you can veto.
- **CEO Action:** Review their decision. If it is sound, say "Go." If not, discuss why.
- **Example:** "Choose the best CRM for our team. Tell me what you picked and why before we sign the contract."
- **When to use:** Moderate-stakes decisions; the team member is experienced but the consequence of a bad decision is significant enough to warrant a check.
- **Team member maturity:** Proficient; makes good decisions most of the time.
- **CEO time investment:** LOW -- a quick review and thumbs-up.

#### Level 5: "Act, Then Tell Me What You Did"

- **Description:** The team member makes the decision AND executes it. They inform the CEO after the fact. This is an "opt-out" model: the CEO only intervenes if something went wrong.
- **CEO Action:** Receive the report. Acknowledge. Only intervene if the outcome is off-track.
- **Example:** "Handle the vendor negotiation. Let me know how it went."
- **When to use:** Decisions within the team member's proven expertise; decisions under a defined spending threshold; reversible decisions.
- **Team member maturity:** Expert; has a track record of good decisions in this domain.
- **CEO time investment:** MINIMAL -- you read a brief update.

#### Level 6: "Act, Don't Even Tell Me"

- **Description:** Full delegation. The team member owns the entire domain. No reporting required unless there is an exception or problem.
- **CEO Action:** Nothing. Trust the system. Only review in aggregate during monthly or quarterly performance reviews.
- **Example:** "You manage all office supply ordering. I do not need to hear about it unless we go over budget."
- **When to use:** Routine, low-stakes, well-understood tasks where the team member has proven complete competence; tasks where CEO oversight adds zero value.
- **Team member maturity:** Fully autonomous; has demonstrated consistent excellence in this area.
- **CEO time investment:** ZERO on an ongoing basis.

### How to Train Team Members Through the Levels

This is a progression, not a static assignment. Here is the training methodology:

**Phase 1: Assess Current Level (Week 1)**
For each team member, list their 5-10 key responsibilities. Assign each responsibility a current level (1-6). Be honest -- most SMB CEOs will find most tasks stuck at Level 1-3.

**Phase 2: Set Target Level (Week 1)**
For each responsibility, set a target level that you want to reach within 90 days. Rule of thumb: aim to move each task up 1-2 levels.

**Phase 3: Create a Delegation Development Plan (Week 2)**

For each task you want to level-up:

| Current Level | Action to Move Up | Timeline |
|--------------|------------------|----------|
| Level 1 -> 2 | Give the "why" behind the instructions. Ask them to research next time. | 2-4 weeks |
| Level 2 -> 3 | After they report findings, ask: "What would YOU recommend?" Train them to bring solutions, not just data. | 2-4 weeks |
| Level 3 -> 4 | Stop asking for options. Tell them: "Make the call, then check with me before you execute." | 4-6 weeks |
| Level 4 -> 5 | Remove the check-in. Say: "Next time, just do it and let me know how it went." | 4-6 weeks |
| Level 5 -> 6 | Remove the reporting requirement for that task. Review only in monthly 1-on-1s. | 2-4 weeks |

**Phase 4: The "Level-Up Conversation" (Ongoing)**
When delegating any task, explicitly state the level: "I'm giving this to you at Level 4. Make the decision, check with me, then execute." This shared language eliminates ambiguity.

When a team member succeeds consistently at one level for 3-4 cycles, have this conversation: "You've been handling [task] at Level 4 for a month and every decision has been strong. I'm moving you to Level 5 on this. Just let me know how it goes from now on."

### Daily Application

**When delegating any task:** Explicitly state the level. "This is a Level 3 -- give me your recommendation by end of day." or "This is a Level 5 -- handle it, let me know how it went."

**When a team member brings something to you:** Ask: "What level are we at on this?" If they bring you raw data (Level 2 behavior) but they should be at Level 3, say: "What do YOU recommend?"

### Weekly Application

**Weekly 1-on-1s (add 5 minutes):** Review one or two tasks per team member and discuss whether it is time to level up. Use this format: "On [task], you've been at Level 3 for three weeks and your recommendations have been solid. Ready to move to Level 4?"

**Monday planning:** Review your delegation board (see below) to ensure tasks are at the correct level and no tasks have slipped back to a lower level.

### The Delegation Board

Create a visual board (whiteboard, spreadsheet, or Notion table):

| Team Member | Task/Decision | Current Level | Target Level | Notes |
|------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| Sarah | Marketing campaigns | 3 | 5 | Recommendations have been strong; move to 4 next week |
| Mike | Vendor negotiations | 2 | 4 | Needs more training on negotiation frameworks |
| Jordan | Hiring (junior roles) | 4 | 5 | Last two hires were excellent; move to 5 |
| Alex | Office operations | 5 | 6 | Eliminate reporting requirement |

### Metrics and Success Criteria

| Metric | Baseline | 90-Day Target | 6-Month Target |
|--------|----------|--------------|----------------|
| Average delegation level across all tasks | Measure baseline | Move average up 1 level | Move average up 2 levels |
| # of tasks at Level 5 or 6 | Count baseline | Double the count | Triple the count |
| CEO hours spent on Level 1-2 tasks per week | Measure baseline | Reduce by 50% | Reduce by 80% |
| Team member confidence (survey, 1-5) | Baseline | 3.5+ | 4.0+ |
| Task quality at delegated levels | Track errors/rework | Equal to CEO quality | Exceeds CEO quality in some areas |

### Time Investment Required

- **Setup:** 3-4 hours (assessing current levels, setting targets, creating the board)
- **Ongoing daily:** 2-3 minutes (stating levels when delegating)
- **Weekly 1-on-1 addition:** 5 minutes per direct report
- **Monthly review:** 30 minutes (updating the delegation board)

### Expected Impact Timeline

- **Week 1-2:** Assessment -- you map the current state; this alone creates awareness
- **Week 3-4:** First level-ups -- move 3-5 tasks up one level
- **Month 2:** Momentum -- team members start asking: "Can I move to Level 5 on this?"
- **Month 3-4:** Visible time savings -- CEO notices 5-10 hours/week freed up
- **Month 6:** Organizational capability -- the team operates 1-2 levels higher across the board, and the CEO focuses almost exclusively on Level 1 decisions (Type 1 strategic decisions)

### How This Prevents the Firefighter CEO Pattern

The firefighter CEO keeps everything at Level 1-3 because it feels safer and faster. But this creates a dependency loop: the team never learns, so the CEO can never let go, so every task remains a "fire" that requires the CEO. The 6 Levels framework breaks this loop by giving the CEO a systematic path to raise each task and each person over time. As tasks move to Level 5-6, entire categories of decisions simply stop reaching the CEO.

## 5. CEO Delegation Research & The 70% Rule

### Name, Source, and Evidence Base

- **Name:** The 70% Rule of Delegation
- **Source:** Jim Schleckser, CEO of The CEO Project and author of "Great CEOs Are Lazy"
- **Evidence Base:**
  - In a Gallup survey of 500+ CEOs, "high delegators" achieved an average 3-year company growth rate of **1,751%** -- 112+ percentage points higher than ineffective delegators.
  - Harvard Business School research: CEOs spend only 43% of their time on activities that further their strategic agendas; 36% is spent in reactive mode.
  - 89% of CEOs spend some amount of time "putting out fires."
  - Organizations with strong delegation practices see **3.5x faster decision-making** and **50% higher employee retention**.

### The 70% Rule Explained

Jim Schleckser's rule is simple and precise:

> **"If the person you would like to do the task is able to do it at least 70% as well as you can, you should delegate it."**

This is radical for most SMB CEOs. Most owners wait until someone can do a task 95-100% as well as they can before delegating. This means they hold onto tasks for months or years longer than necessary.

**The critical corollary:** Once you delegate at 70%, do NOT try to coach the person up to close the 30% gap. Let them find their own way. They may eventually do it differently but equally well, or they may develop a better approach than yours.

**The one exception:** Tasks requiring 100% accuracy (compliance filings, legal documents, safety-critical operations) should not use the 70% rule. These require extensive training and verification before delegation.

### What Percentage of CEO Decisions Can Be Delegated?

Based on the research synthesis:

| Decision Category | % That Can Be Delegated | Evidence Source |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Operational/tactical decisions | 85-95% | Bain, McKinsey |
| Financial decisions (under threshold) | 70-80% | The CEO Project |
| People/HR decisions (non-senior) | 60-75% | Gallup |
| Strategic decisions (Type 1) | 10-20% | Bezos framework |
| **Overall for a typical SMB CEO** | **60-80%** | Composite |

The research consistently shows that **a well-functioning SMB should have 60-80% of all decisions being made without the CEO.** Most SMBs under $50M start at 20-40% delegation. The gap represents the CEO's single largest time and growth opportunity.

### Methodology for Systematically Increasing Delegation

#### The 6-Step CEO Delegation Methodology

**Step 1: The Decision Audit (Week 1-2)**
For two full weeks, log every decision you make. Use a simple spreadsheet:
- Date/time
- Decision description
- Time spent
- Could someone else have made this? (Yes/No)
- Who? (name the specific person)
- Why didn't they? (no authority? no knowledge? no confidence? habit?)

At the end of two weeks, you will have a complete picture. Most CEOs discover that 60-80% of their decisions should have been made by someone else.

**Step 2: The 70% Assessment (Week 3)**
For each decision you flagged as "someone else could do this," assess the person:
- Can they do this at 70% of your quality? If YES --> delegate immediately
- Can they reach 70% with 2-4 weeks of training? If YES --> start training now, delegate in 30 days
- Will they never reach 70%? --> This stays with you, OR you need to hire for this capability

**Step 3: The Delegation Wave (Month 1-2)**
Do NOT try to delegate everything at once. Instead, delegate in waves of 3-5 decisions every two weeks:
- **Wave 1 (Week 3-4):** Delegate 3-5 of the easiest, lowest-risk decisions
- **Wave 2 (Week 5-6):** Delegate 3-5 more, slightly higher complexity
- **Wave 3 (Week 7-8):** Delegate 3-5 more, including some that make you uncomfortable
- **Continue waves** until you reach your target delegation ratio

**Step 4: The Support Structure (Ongoing)**
For each delegated decision, provide:
- Clear decision criteria (when to say yes, when to say no)
- Spending/authority limits
- Escalation triggers (when to bring it back to the CEO)
- A 30-day check-in to review how it is going

**Step 5: The Feedback Loop (Monthly)**
In your monthly review:
- How many decisions were delegated vs. held?
- What was the outcome quality of delegated decisions?
- Did any delegated decisions need CEO correction? Why?
- Which team members are ready for more delegation?

**Step 6: The Ratchet (Quarterly)**
Every quarter, increase delegation by one level:
- Quarter 1: Delegate 60% of decisions
- Quarter 2: Delegate 70% of decisions
- Quarter 3: Delegate 75% of decisions
- Quarter 4: Delegate 80%+ of decisions

This "ratchet" approach ensures continuous progress without overwhelming the team.

### The 70-20-10 Delegation Training Model

For developing your team's decision-making capability:

| Method | % of Development | Activities |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Learning by Doing (70%)** | 70% | Real decision-making responsibility with increasing stakes, stretch assignments, temporary leadership of cross-functional projects |
| **Coaching & Mentorship (20%)** | 20% | Weekly 1-on-1s reviewing decision quality, after-action reviews on big decisions, peer mentoring across departments |
| **Formal Training (10%)** | 10% | Decision-making frameworks training (this document), executive coaching for senior leaders, workshops on financial analysis and strategic thinking |

### Daily Application

**Morning question (30 seconds):** Before engaging with any task, ask: "Am I the right person to do this, or is there someone who can do this at 70%?"

**The "Give It Back" practice:** When a team member brings you a decision, and you know they could handle it at 70%, hand it back: "I think you've got this. Make the call. I trust your judgment."

### Weekly Application

**Monday planning (15 minutes):** Review the week's decisions. Pre-delegate everything that passes the 70% test. Your goal: enter the week with 80% of known decisions already assigned to others.

**Friday tracking (10 minutes):** Count your decisions this week. Calculate delegation ratio: (decisions others made) / (total decisions). Track this weekly trending upward.

### Metrics and Success Criteria

| Metric | Baseline | 90-Day Target | 6-Month Target |
|--------|----------|--------------|----------------|
| CEO delegation ratio | Measure baseline (typically 20-40%) | 55-65% | 70-80% |
| CEO hours on delegable decisions | Measure baseline | Reduce by 40% | Reduce by 70% |
| Decision outcome quality (delegated) | Measure baseline | Within 80% of CEO quality | Within 90% of CEO quality |
| Team member decision confidence (survey) | Baseline | Increase by 1 point (1-5 scale) | Increase by 2 points |
| Revenue per CEO hour (strategic time) | Baseline | Track improvement | 2x improvement |
| Company growth rate | Baseline | Track | Correlated with delegation increase |

### Time Investment Required

- **Decision audit (one-time):** 10-15 minutes per day for 2 weeks
- **70% assessment (one-time):** 3-4 hours
- **Delegation waves:** 2-3 hours per wave (every 2 weeks for 2 months)
- **Ongoing daily:** 5 minutes (pre-delegation and give-it-back practice)
- **Weekly tracking:** 25 minutes
- **Monthly review:** 1 hour
- **Quarterly ratchet:** 2 hours

### Expected Impact Timeline

- **Week 1-2:** The audit reveals the gap (most CEOs are shocked)
- **Month 1:** First delegation wave; feels uncomfortable; 10% of time freed
- **Month 2:** Second and third waves; team starts stepping up; 20% of time freed
- **Month 3:** Delegation becomes habitual; CEO has 5-10 more hours/week for strategic work
- **Month 6:** CEO operates at 70-80% delegation; company growth accelerates because the CEO is focused on the 20% of decisions that drive 80% of value

### How This Prevents the Firefighter CEO Pattern

The firefighter CEO holds decisions because "nobody can do it as well as I can." The 70% Rule reframes this: **perfection is not the standard -- 70% is.** Most of the decisions the CEO fights fires over could be handled at 70%+ quality by someone on the team. By systematically identifying and delegating these, the CEO transitions from firefighter to strategist. The research shows that companies led by high-delegation CEOs grow 112 percentage points faster -- not despite imperfect delegation, but because the CEO's freed-up time creates exponentially more value than the 30% quality gap on individual delegated tasks.

## 6. Decision Journaling

### Name, Source, and Evidence Base

- **Name:** Decision Journal / Decision Log
- **Sources:**
  - **Shane Parrish / Farnam Street** -- the most widely referenced decision journal framework for executives
  - **Daniel Kahneman** -- Nobel laureate whose work on cognitive bias (System 1/System 2 thinking) provides the scientific foundation
  - **Cloverpop** (decision intelligence platform) -- enterprise decision tracking research
  - **Annie Duke** -- former poker professional and author of "Thinking in Bets," who advocates for decision journaling to separate decision quality from outcome quality
- **Evidence Base:**
  - Managers using decision logs saw a **20% boost in overall performance** (Cloverpop study)
  - Decision journaling forces **System 2 thinking** (Kahneman's slow, deliberate, analytical mode) for high-stakes decisions
  - Bain research: companies linking executive decisions to tracked outcomes and metrics outperformed on revenue growth, ROC, and TSR

### The Farnam Street Decision Journal Template

Shane Parrish describes the decision journal as **"quality control for your thinking -- something like what we'd find in a manufacturing plant."** The key insight: **record your thinking BEFORE you know the outcome**, not after.

#### Core Fields (Required for Every Logged Decision)

| Field | What to Write | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Decision Number** | Sequential tracking number | #047 |
| **Date and Time** | When you are making the decision | 2026-02-09, 10:30 AM |
| **Decision Statement** | Clear, simple description (an 8-year-old should understand it) | "We are going to hire a full-time CFO instead of continuing with our part-time bookkeeper and quarterly CPA." |
| **Situation/Context** | What is happening that requires this decision? | "Revenue hit $3.2M. Financial complexity is increasing. We made two cash flow mistakes last quarter that cost us $18K." |
| **Variables That Matter** | The key factors driving this decision | "Cost of hire ($120K-$150K), current financial error rate, growth trajectory, my time spent on finance (8 hrs/week)" |
| **Alternatives Considered** | What other options did you seriously consider, and why you rejected each | "1) Upgrade bookkeeper to full-time -- rejected because skill ceiling too low. 2) Hire fractional CFO -- rejected because we need daily presence. 3) Do nothing -- rejected because errors are increasing." |
| **Expected Outcome** | What you think will happen, with your confidence level | "70% confident: the CFO will reduce financial errors to near zero and save me 6-8 hrs/week within 90 days. 20% risk: the hire does not work out and we waste 3-6 months and $40K-$75K." |
| **Probabilities** | Assign percentages to different outcomes | "Success (saves time + reduces errors): 70%. Partial success (reduces errors but not my time): 15%. Failure (bad hire): 15%." |
| **Physical/Mental State** | How you feel right now | "Well-rested. Slightly anxious about the expense. Feeling pressured by last quarter's mistakes." |
| **What Would Change My Mind** | Pre-commit to evidence that would reverse this decision | "If we find a fractional CFO with daily availability for under $80K/year, I would reconsider. If revenue drops below $2.5M before we hire, I would postpone." |

#### Enhanced Fields (Optional, for Major Decisions)

| Field | What to Write |
|-------|-------------|
| **Second-Order Consequences** | What happens AFTER the first outcome? (e.g., "Hiring a CFO means I need to give them access to all financial data and some strategic decision-making authority") |
| **Third-Order Consequences** | What happens after that? (e.g., "Other team members may expect similar senior hires in their departments") |
| **Worst-Case Scenario** | What is the absolute worst that can happen? How survivable is it? |
| **Upside Beyond Expectations** | What is the best case? What opportunities might this unlock? |
| **Opportunity Cost** | What am I giving up by choosing this? |
| **Who Should Ideally Make This Decision?** | Am I the right person, or should this be delegated? |
| **5/5/5 Test** | How will I feel about this decision in 5 weeks? 5 months? 5 years? |

### Implementation: The Daily Practice

**Daily logging (5-10 minutes, end of day):**
At the end of each workday, ask: "Did I make any decision today that I want to track?" The threshold for logging should be:
- Any decision involving more than $5,000
- Any decision affecting more than 3 people
- Any decision that is irreversible or hard to reverse
- Any decision where you felt significant uncertainty
- Any decision where your gut and your data disagreed

Most CEOs will log 2-5 decisions per week. Do NOT log every decision -- focus on the ones with lasting impact.

**The 3-minute evening entry:**
Use this abbreviated format for quick logging:
```
Date: [date]
Decision: [one sentence]
Why: [one sentence]
Confidence: [high/medium/low]
Expected outcome: [one sentence]
Review date: [date to check results]
```

### Implementation: The Weekly Practice

**Friday review (15 minutes):**
1. Review all decisions logged this week
2. For each, ask: "Does this still feel right with 5 days of perspective?"
3. Flag any decision you would change if you could
4. Check if any past decisions are due for outcome review

### Implementation: The Monthly Practice

**Monthly decision review (45 minutes, first Monday of each month):**
1. Review all decisions from the past month
2. Count: How many were logged? How many total decisions were made? (This reveals your logging consistency)
3. For decisions logged 30+ days ago: compare your expected outcome to what actually happened
4. Look for patterns:
   - Are you consistently overconfident or underconfident?
   - Do you make worse decisions at certain times of day?
   - Are there categories where your judgment is strong or weak?
   - Do you see the same cognitive biases repeating (confirmation bias, sunk cost, anchoring)?
5. Write a one-paragraph "Decision Quality Summary" for the month

### Implementation: The Quarterly Practice

**Quarterly deep review (2 hours, every 90 days):**
1. Review all decisions from the past quarter
2. Calculate your "decision batting average": % of decisions where the actual outcome matched or exceeded your prediction
3. Identify your top 3 decision strengths and top 3 decision weaknesses
4. Set one specific improvement goal for next quarter (e.g., "Slow down on hiring decisions -- take at least 72 hours before final commitment")
5. Review which decisions should have been delegated but were not
6. Share relevant insights with your leadership team

### Common Cognitive Biases to Track

| Bias | What It Looks Like | Journal Question to Surface It |
|------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Confirmation Bias** | Seeking only information that supports your existing belief | "What evidence would DISPROVE my preferred option?" |
| **Sunk Cost Fallacy** | Continuing because you have already invested time/money | "If I were starting fresh today, would I make this same choice?" |
| **Anchoring** | Over-relying on the first piece of information you received | "Am I being influenced by the first number/option I heard?" |
| **Overconfidence** | Believing you know more than you do | "What is my confidence level, and how often have I been right at that level historically?" |
| **Recency Bias** | Over-weighting recent events | "Am I reacting to what happened this week, or is this a true pattern?" |
| **Status Quo Bias** | Preferring things to stay the same | "If I were not already doing it this way, would I choose this approach?" |
| **Availability Bias** | Judging likelihood by how easily examples come to mind | "Am I thinking of the most likely outcome, or just the most vivid/recent example?" |

### Metrics and Success Criteria

| Metric | Baseline | 90-Day Target | 6-Month Target |
|--------|----------|--------------|----------------|
| Decisions logged per week | 0 | 2-5 per week consistently | 3-5 per week consistently |
| Decision batting average | Unknown | Establish baseline | Improve by 10% |
| Decisions reviewed at 90-day mark | 0 | 80%+ of logged decisions reviewed | 90%+ reviewed |
| Identified biases per quarter | Unknown | Name top 3 | Active mitigation strategies for each |
| Decision regret rate | Unknown (estimate) | Track and reduce | 20% reduction |
| Repeat mistakes (same error type) | Unknown | Identify patterns | Reduce frequency by 50% |

### Time Investment Required

- **Setup:** 30 minutes (create your journal template -- Google Doc, Notion page, or physical notebook)
- **Daily logging:** 5-10 minutes (only on days with loggable decisions)
- **Weekly review:** 15 minutes
- **Monthly review:** 45 minutes
- **Quarterly deep review:** 2 hours
- **Total weekly investment:** ~30-45 minutes

### Expected Impact Timeline

- **Week 1-4:** You start noticing your thinking patterns for the first time. The act of writing forces clarity.
- **Month 2-3:** Your first batch of decisions comes up for review. You begin seeing patterns you were blind to.
- **Month 4-6:** You develop a "meta-awareness" of your decision-making. You catch biases in real-time before they influence your choices.
- **Month 6-12:** Your decision quality measurably improves. You have a historical record that informs future decisions. Your team sees a more deliberate, consistent leader.
- **Year 2+:** The journal becomes your most valuable leadership tool. You can look back at years of decisions and see exactly how and why your thinking evolved.

### How This Prevents the Firefighter CEO Pattern

The firefighter CEO makes decisions reactively, in the heat of the moment, without reflection. They repeat the same mistakes because they never track what happened. The Decision Journal forces a pause: before you act on a major decision, you WRITE DOWN your thinking. This single act shifts you from reactive (System 1) to deliberate (System 2). The review process then creates a feedback loop that prevents repeat errors. Over time, the CEO learns their own patterns -- when they tend to be right, when they tend to be wrong, and what conditions lead to poor decisions. This self-knowledge is the antidote to chronic firefighting.

## 7. Integrated Implementation Calendar

### How All 6 Frameworks Work Together

These six frameworks are not competing systems -- they are layers of a single decision-operating system:

```
LAYER 1: CLASSIFICATION
  Bezos Type 1/Type 2 Framework
  --> Classifies every decision as reversible or irreversible

LAYER 2: ROUTING
  The Decision Filter
  --> Routes classified decisions to the right person/level

LAYER 3: ROLE CLARITY
  RAPID Framework
  --> For decisions that reach teams, defines who Recommends, Agrees, Performs, has Input, and Decides

LAYER 4: AUTHORITY CALIBRATION
  6 Levels of Delegation
  --> For each delegated decision, defines how much autonomy the delegate has

LAYER 5: CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
  The 70% Rule + Delegation Methodology
  --> Systematically increases delegation over time

LAYER 6: LEARNING
  Decision Journaling
  --> Tracks outcomes and improves decision quality over time
```

### 90-Day Implementation Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

| Week | Actions | Time Investment |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Week 1 | Start the Decision Audit: log every decision for 2 weeks. Set up your Decision Journal (pick a format -- notebook, Google Doc, Notion). Start logging your most important daily decisions. | 20 min/day |
| Week 2 | Continue the Decision Audit. Begin classifying decisions as Type 1 or Type 2 in your log. | 20 min/day |
| Week 3 | Analyze the audit: categorize all logged decisions. Build your CEO Decision Filter (the must-reach-CEO vs. delegate list). Conduct the 70% Assessment for each delegable decision. | 4-6 hours (one time) |
| Week 4 | Create the Decision Rights Matrix (40-60 line items). Map RAPID roles for your top 15-20 recurring decisions. Set delegation levels for each team member's responsibilities. Share the system with your leadership team in a 60-minute meeting. | 6-8 hours (one time) + 60-min meeting |

#### Phase 2: Activation (Weeks 5-8)

| Week | Actions | Time Investment |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Week 5 | Launch Wave 1 delegation: move 3-5 decisions to others. Start using Type 1/Type 2 language daily. Begin piloting RAPID on 5 key decisions. | 2-3 hrs/week |
| Week 6 | Launch Wave 2 delegation: move 3-5 more decisions. Conduct first Friday decision review. Check in with team on RAPID clarity. | 2-3 hrs/week |
| Week 7 | Launch Wave 3 delegation. Begin moving team members up the delegation levels. Conduct first monthly decision journal review. | 2-3 hrs/week |
| Week 8 | Mid-point assessment: How many decisions are you still making that could be delegated? Update Decision Rights Matrix based on first month of learnings. | 2 hrs (one time) |

#### Phase 3: Acceleration (Weeks 9-12)

| Week | Actions | Time Investment |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Week 9-10 | Continue delegation waves. Conduct level-up conversations with team members who are ready. Expand RAPID to all 15-20 mapped decisions. | 1-2 hrs/week |
| Week 11 | Second monthly decision journal review. Look for patterns and biases. Ratchet: set a higher delegation target for next quarter. | 1 hr (one time) |
| Week 12 | Full quarterly review: Decision Quality Assessment, Delegation Board update, RAPID audit, Decision Filter refinement. Celebrate progress -- you should have 5-10+ more strategic hours per week. | 3-4 hrs (one time) |

### Ongoing Weekly Rhythm After 90 Days

| Day | Activity | Time |
|-----|----------|------|
| **Monday** | Review week's decisions; pre-classify Type 1/Type 2; pre-delegate Type 2s; check Decision Rights Matrix | 15 min |
| **Tuesday-Thursday** | Apply frameworks in real-time: classify, route, delegate, journal | 5-10 min/day |
| **Friday** | Weekly decision review: count decisions, check delegation ratio, log journal entries, review RAPID compliance | 20 min |
| **First Monday of month** | Monthly decision journal review: patterns, biases, batting average | 45 min |
| **End of each quarter** | Full system audit: update all frameworks, ratchet delegation higher, conduct team assessment | 3-4 hrs |

### The Compound Effect

The power of these frameworks is compound. In isolation, each saves 2-5 hours per week. Together, they create a system that:

- **Month 1:** Saves 5-8 hours per week (initial delegation + classification)
- **Month 3:** Saves 10-15 hours per week (team adopts the system; decisions flow to the right level)
- **Month 6:** Saves 15-20 hours per week (the system is self-sustaining; the CEO operates almost exclusively on strategic, Type 1, irreversible decisions)
- **Year 1:** The CEO is working ON the business, not IN it. The company's decision-making speed has increased 2-3x. The team is more capable, confident, and autonomous. The CEO has reclaimed 40-60% of their time for strategic growth activities.

This is how you stop being the firefighter CEO and become the architect CEO.
